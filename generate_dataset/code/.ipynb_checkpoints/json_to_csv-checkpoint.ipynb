       " 'recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (ifitm) family proteins, ifitm3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza a (h1n1) virus infection. in this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed s-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. ifitm3 possesses three cysteine residues for the s-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (tm1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (cp) loop. because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian ifitm family proteins, the s-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. ifitm5 is another ifitm family protein and interacts with the fk506-binding protein 11 (fkbp11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. in this study, we investigated the role played by s-palmitoylation of ifitm5 in its interaction with fkbp11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression.',\n",

       " 'it can be achieved by specific protein kinase phosphatases which can remove the phosphate group from mapks. examples of these phosphatases include tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases (dusps). some dusps are also known as mapk phosphatases (mkps)    . currently, there are at least 10 mkps identified, while mkp-1 is the most studied member of the family. the regulatory role of mkp-1 on cytokine induction is best demonstrated by mkp-1 knockout (ko) macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (lps), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. mkp-1 ko macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p38 mapk and jnk as well as increased production of tnf-α in response to lps treatment  . consistent with these results, another group further revealed that lps-treated mkp-1 ko bone marrow-derived macrophages show increased ap-1 dna-binding activity  .',\n",

       " 'despite the availability of an inactivated vaccine that has been licensed for >50 years, the influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains. thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity. in addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection.',\n",
       " 'moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses. this review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines.text: seasonal influenza is a worldwide health problem causing high mobility and substantial mortality     . moreover, influenza infection often worsens preexisting medical conditions    . vaccines against circulating influenza strains are available and updated annually, but many issues are still present, including low efficacy in the populations at greatest risk of complications from influenza virus infection, i.e., the young and elderly [8, 9] . despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing [8, 10] , and substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently approved anti-viral drugs [11, 12] .',\n",
       " 'while adjuvants have the potential to improve efficacy and availability of current inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated and virus-vectored vaccines are still considered one of the best options for the induction of broad and efficacious immunity to the influenza virus  .the general types of influenza vaccines available in the united states are trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (tiv), quadrivalent influenza vaccine (qiv), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (laiv; in trivalent and quadrivalent forms). there are three types of inactivated vaccines that include whole virus inactivated, split virus inactivated, and subunit vaccines. in split virus vaccines, the virus is disrupted by a detergent. in subunit vaccines, ha and na have been further purified by removal of other viral components. tiv is administered intramuscularly and contains three or four inactivated viruses, i.e., two type a strains (h1 and h3) and one or two type b strains.',\n",
       " 'tiv efficacy is measured by induction of humoral responses to the hemagglutinin (ha) protein, the major surface and attachment glycoprotein on influenza. serum antibody responses to ha are measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition (hi) assay, and the strain-specific hi titer is considered the gold-standard correlate of immunity to influenza where a four-fold increase in titer post-vaccination, or a hi titer of ≥1:40 is considered protective [4, 14] . protection against clinical disease is mainly conferred by serum antibodies; however, mucosal iga antibodies also may contribute to resistance against infection. split virus inactivated vaccines can induce neuraminidase (na)-specific antibody responses    , and anti-na antibodies have been associated with protection from infection in humans      . currently, na-specific antibody responses are not considered a correlate of protection  . laiv is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone  .',\n",
       " 'laiv are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature, but replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx  . laiv immunization induces serum antibody responses, mucosal antibody responses (iga), and t cell responses. while robust serum antibody and nasal wash (mucosal) antibody responses are associated with protection from infection, other immune responses, such as cd8 + cytotoxic lymphocyte (ctl) responses may contribute to protection and there is not a clear correlate of immunity for laiv [4, 14, 24] .currently licensed influenza virus vaccines suffer from a number of issues. the inactivated vaccines rely on specific antibody responses to the ha, and to a lesser extent na proteins for protection. the immunodominant portions of the ha and na molecules undergo a constant process of antigenic drift, a natural accumulation of mutations, enabling virus evasion from immunity [9, 25] .',\n",
       " 'thus, the circulating influenza a and b strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines, replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection [4, 26, 27] . for the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in february and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall  . if the prediction is imperfect, or if manufacturers have issues with vaccine production, vaccine efficacy or availability can be compromised  . laiv is not recommended for all populations; however, it is generally considered to be as effective as inactivated vaccines and may be more efficacious in children [4, 9, 24] .',\n",
       " 'while laiv relies on antigenic match and the ha and na antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the tiv [4, 9] , there is some suggestion that laiv may induce broader protection than tiv due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive t cell responses [9, 23, 29] . while overall both tiv and laiv are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines  . moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery    .virus-vectored vaccines share many of the advantages of laiv, as well as those unique to the vectors. recombinant dna systems exist that allow ready manipulation and modification of the vector genome.',\n",

       " 'however, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (rr=1.4, 95% ci: 0.98–2.00) to have severe symptoms of covid-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an icu, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (rr=2.4, 95% ci: 1.43–4.04). in conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of covid-19.text: non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from covid-19. similarly, zhang et al. 10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with covid-19. the results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an or of 2.23; (95% ci: 0.65-7.63; p=0.2).',\n",
       " 'previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous mers-cov outbreak(7,8). given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on covid-19 that included information on patients’ smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and covid-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (icu) hospitalization and death. the literature search was conducted on 17 march 2020, using two databases (pubmed, sciencedirect), with the search terms: [‘smoking’ or ‘tobacco’ or ‘risk factors’ or ‘smoker*’] and [‘covid-19’ or ‘covid 19’ or ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘sars cov-2’ or ‘sars cov 2’] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in english and referred to humans.',\n",
       " 'while most cases originated within mainland china, the disease spread to neighboring countries including taiwan, thailand, south korea, and japan, and later to the united states, europe, and australia. a near real-time updated tracking website for cases and locations worldwide, along with reported deaths is available. 2 chinese health authorities have sequenced 2019-ncov and freely shared its genetic profile online. 3, 4 additionally, on january 28, 2020, an australian laboratory reported growing the virus from a patient sample. as of january 30, 2020, there have been at least 9,776 persons infected and 213 verified deaths. 2 these numbers are likely underestimates due to the limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin. the what was the research question? investigators adapted the \"identify, isolate, inform\" (3i) tool for use in suspected cases of 2019-ncov.what was the major finding of the study?',\n",
       " 'on january 15, 2020, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) confirmed the first known imported case of 2019-ncov in the us state of washington. the patient had recently returned from wuhan city, where he likely contracted the disease. chicago health authorities reported a second us case on january 24, 2020. this was quickly followed by additional imported cases reported in orange and los angeles counties, california on january 26, 2020. additional suspected cases continue to be evaluated. on january 30, 2020, the cdc reported the first local transmission in the us between members in a household. on the same day, the world health organization declared 2019-ncov to be a public health emergency of international concern (pheic). 6 on january 31, 2020, the us department of health and human services declared coronavirus a public health emergency. 7 healthy individuals and those with mild illness may be asymptomatic, while others may have more pronounced symptoms of fever or lower respiratory illness.',\n",
       " '18 coronavirus 2019-ncov infection commonly presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia or as a nonspecific lower respiratory illness, with coughing or difficulty breathing accompanied by fever. 5, 19, 20 fever and cough constitute the most common presentations. however, patients may have other respiratory symptoms, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgia, and headache. bilateral infiltrates may be seen on chest x-ray. severe cases may present with sepsis and even shock. conversely, some patients may present as only mildly ill or asymptomatic altogether. 21 to date, patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly are more likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization, and ultimately die. 22 early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similar coronaviruses. the 14-day criterion for epidemiological risk assumes the longest estimated incubation time. 23 in addition, the world health organization (who) has created its own interim case definition.',\n",
       " \"once determined to be bioterrorism, management of the event was similar to that for a chemical exposure with a sudden impact, defined scene, and need for a rapid response and decontamination on site. this differed from the who's modeling predicting an aerosolized release that would result in an incubation period with 100,000 or more persons exposed rather than the 22 people who contracted anthrax in 2001. 32 by understanding the key features of a novel disease, healthcare workers can take evidence-based measures to protect themselves, optimize individual patient management, and prevent further disease spread.it is currently unclear how 2019-ncov is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. there are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in wuhan city. 21 current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission.\",\n",
       " '35like other related coronaviruses, patients with 2019-ncov frequently present with non-specific symptoms resembling that of influenza. physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. in order to relate these symptoms to 2019-ncov, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-ncov can be completed. although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-ncov and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-ncov. many commercially available respiratory panels include \"coronavirus\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-ncov.supportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current cdc treatment guidelines for 2019-ncov.',\n",
       " 'nantext: over 168 million people across 50 countries are estimated to need humanitarian assistance in 2020  . response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisessuch as the recent cholera epidemic in yemen and the ebola epidemic in the democratic republic of congois a global health challenge of increasing scale  . the thousands of yemeni and congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings.populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to covid-19, the disease caused by sars-cov-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (wash) tools, and stigmatization.',\n",
       " 'disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. these situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations  .as the international community responds to sars-cov-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. these standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. for example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises.',\n",
       " 'frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on crisesaffected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as sars-cov-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing  .',\n",
       " \"hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30%  . furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production  .the sphere handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance  . however, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian wash standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8] .\",\n",
       " 'and yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence  . gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current sars-cov-2 pandemic. without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations  . diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings  .',\n",
       " 'the case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in table 1 .on november 11, 1918 , the fighting of world war i was stopped, and world war i was officially ended on june 28, 1919 with the signing of the versailles treaty. it is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in world war i due to battle. the war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. for example, about 700,000 germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide.',\n",
       " 'nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like tylenol or advil. we do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time.',\n",
       " 'actually, in the united states of america, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) .because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future.additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie b virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) .the world health organization (who) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on june 11, 2009 (15) .',\n",
       " 'however, the truth was that most cases of h1n1 influenza a virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in new zealand (16) ; and in new york city, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . i believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. the severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity.',\n",
       " \"aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of h7n9 influenza a virus infection in beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza a h7n9 infection. the reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. in most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from taiwan, and one case from hong kong) (22, 23).nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other rna viruses.\",\n",
       " 'however, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. i believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the who global influenza surveillance and response system, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. now, i first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. we should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. it is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future.']"
