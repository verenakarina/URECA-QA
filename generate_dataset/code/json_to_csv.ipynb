       "[['BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors.',\n",
       "  'The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.Text: Without specific interventions, the rate of HIV-1 mother-tochild transmission (MTCT) is approximately 15-45%  . UNAIDS estimates that last year alone, more than 400,000 children were infected worldwide, mostly through MTCT and 90% of them lived in sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",
       "  'In the most heavilyaffected countries, such as Zimbabwe, HIV-1 is responsible for one third of all deaths among children under the age of five. MTCT of HIV-1 can occur during pregnancy (in utero, IU), delivery (intrapartum, IP) or breastfeeding (postpartum, PP). High maternal viral load, low CD4 cells count, vaginal delivery, low gestational age have all been identified as independent factors associated with MTCT of HIV-1  . Although antiretrovirals can reduce MTCT to 2%, limited access to timely diagnostics and drugs in many developing world countries limits the potential impact of this strategy. A better understanding of the mechanisms acting at the maternal-fetal interface is crucial for the design of alternative interventions to antiretroviral therapy for transmission prevention.Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)) can interact with a plethora of pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed in placental capillary endothelial cells  .',\n",
       "  'DC-SIGNR is organized in three distinct domains, an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a repeat region containing seven repeat of 23 amino acids and a C-terminal domain implicated in pathogen binding. Alternative splicing of DC-SIGNR gene leads to the production of a highly diversify isoforms repertoire which includes membrane-bound and soluble isoforms  . It has been proposed that interaction between DC-SIGNR and HIV-1 might enhance viral transfer to other susceptible cell types  but DC-SIGNR can also internalize and mediate proteasome-dependant degradation of viruses  that may differently affect the outcome of infection.Given the presence of DC-SIGNR at the maternal-fetal interface and its interaction with HIV-1, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Zimbabwe, and identified specific DC-SIGNR variants associated with increased risks of HIV transmission.',\n",
       "  'We further characterized the functional impact of these genetic variants on DC-SIGNR expression and show that they affect both the level and type of DC-SIGNR transcripts produced in the placenta.Samples consisted of stored DNA extracts obtained from 197 mother-child pairs co-enrolled immediately postpartum in the ZVITAMBO Vitamin A supplementation trial (Harare, Zimbabwe) and followed at 6 weeks, and 3-monthly intervals up to 24 months. The ZVITAMBO project was a randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial that enrolled 14,110 mother-child pairs, between November 1997 and January 2000, with the main objective of investigating the impact of immediate postpartum vitamin A supplementation on MTCT of HIV-1. The samples used in the present study were from mother-child pairs randomly assigned to the placebo group of the ZVITAMBO project. Antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-1-positive antenatal women was not available in the Harare public-sector during ZVITAMBO patient recruitment. The samples were consecutively drawn from two groups: 97 HIV-1-positive mother/HIV-1-positive child pairs and 100 HIV-1-positive mother/HIV-negative child pairs.',\n",
       "  \"Mother's serological status was determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot. Infants were considered to be infected if they were HIV-1 seropositive at 18 months or older and had two or more positive HIV-1-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results at earlier ages. 100 infants were considered to be uninfected as they were ELISA negative at 18 months or older and had two DNA PCR negative results from samples collected at a younger age. Of the 97 HIV-1-infected infants, 57 were infected IU, 11 were infected IP, and 17 were infected PP as determined by PCR analyses of blood samples collected at birth, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months of age and according to the following definitions adapted from Bryson and colleagues  . Briefly, infants who were DNA PCR positive at birth were infected IU. Infants with negative PCR results from sample obtained at birth but who become positive by 6 weeks of age were infected IP.\",\n",

Full methods for recruitment, baseline characteristics collection, laboratory procedures have been described elsewhere  .The nucleotide sequence variation of the entire promoter, coding and part of 39-UTR regions of DC-SIGNR gene in the study population was determined previously  . Haplotype reconstruction was performed using Bayesian statistical method implemented in PHASE  , version 2.1.1, using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 2%. We applied the algorithm five times, using different randomly generated seeds, and consistent results were obtained across runs ( Figure 1 ). Fifteen haplotype-tagged SNPs (htSNPs) were identified by the HaploBlockFinder software  with a MAF $5%.',\n",
       "  'These htSNPs were genotyped in the 197 infants by direct PCR sequencing analysis as we have described previously  . The DC-SIGNR exon 4 repeat region genotype was determined by PCR amplification followed by migration in 1.5% agarose gels  . DNA sequences in the promoter region were analysed with the TESS interface (http//:www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) for putative transcription factors binding sites using the TRANSFAC database.Luciferase reporter assays using pGL2-Basic vector were performed in order to investigate the functional effect of mutations on DC-SIGNR promoter activity. Genomic DNA from subjects homozygous for the promoter variants and WT was amplified from nucleotide position 2715 to 21 and cloned between the BglII and HindIII multiple cloning sites in the pGL2-Basic vector which harbours a reporter firefly luciferase gene downstream (Invitrogen Canada inc, Burlington, Canada). All recombinants clones were verified by DNA sequencing. The firefly luciferase test reporter vector was co-transfected at a ratio of 10:1 with the constitutive expressor of Renilla luciferase, phRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).',\n",

Cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed using 20 mg of protein extract according to the manufacturer (Promega) at 44 h post-transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. 0 mg, 0,5 mg or 1 mg CMV-Tat vector was transfected with LTR-Luc as a positive control in these experiments.

Samples from 2 subjects in each group were used because RNA quality of others was not suitable for a qRT-PCR analysis. Amplification of all DC-SIGNR isoforms was performed using an exon 5 specific primer pair (Table S1 ). Membrane-bound isoforms were amplified using primers specific for exon 3, corresponding to the common trans-membrane domain of DC-SIGNR.',\n",

Standard curves (50-500 000 copies per reaction) were generated using serial dilution of a full-length DC-SIGNR or commercial GAPDH (Invitrogen) plasmid DNA. All qPCR reactions had efficiencies ranging from 99% to 100%, even in the presence of 20 ng of non-specific nucleic acids, and therefore could be compared. The copy number of unknown samples was estimated by placing the measured PCR cycle number (crossing threshold) on the standard curve. To correct for differences in both RNA quality and quantity between samples, the expression levels of transcripts were normalised to the reference GAPDH gene transcripts. GAPDH primer sequences were kindly provided by A. Mes-Masson at the CHUM. The results are presented as target gene copy number per 10 5 copies of GAPDH.',\n",

Differences in baseline characteristics and genotypic frequencies of haplotypes or htSNPs were compared between groups using the x 2 analysis or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for each genotype and baseline risk factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to define independent predictors identified as significant in the crude analysis. ORs and 95% confidence interval were calculated with the exact method.

Among them, 97 infants were HIV-1-infected and 100 infants remained uninfected. Of the 97 HIV-1-infected infants, 57 were infected IU, 11 were infected IP, and 17 were infected PP. Timing of infection was not determined for 12 HIV-1-infected infants. Baseline characteristics of mothers and infants are presented in Table 1 . Maternal age and CD4 cell count, child sex, mode of delivery, duration of membrane rupture and gestational age were similar among all groups.',\n",
       "  'However, maternal viral load .29 000 copies/ml was associated with increased risk in both IU and PP with odds ratios (OR) of 3.64 (95% CI = 1.82-7.31, P = 0.0002) and 4.45 (95% CI = 1.50-13.2, P = 0.0045) for HIV-1 transmission, respectively.Fifteen haplotype-tagged SNPs (htSNPs) corresponding to the 15 major DC-SIGNR haplotypes ( Figure 1 ) described among Zimbabweans  were genotyped in our study samples (Tables S2 and S3 ). H1 (31%) and H3 (11%) were the most frequent haplotypes observed (Figure 1 ). Being homozygous for the H1 haplotype was associated with increased risk of both IU (OR: 4.42, P = 0.022) and PP (OR: 7.31, P = 0.016) HIV-1 transmission ( Table 2) . Infants harbouring two copy combinations of H1 and/ or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3 or H3-H3) had increased risk of IU (OR: 3.42, P = 0.007) and IP (OR: 5.71, P = 0.025) but not PP (P = 0.098) HIV-1 infection compared to infant noncarriers ( Table 2 ).',\n",

The H1 and H3 haplotypes share a cluster of mutations (p-198A, int2-391C, int2-180A, ex4RPT, int5+7C) ( Figure 1 ). Of these, the p-198A and int2-180A variants were significantly associated with MTCT of HIV-1 (Table S2 ). In the unadjusted regression analysis, homozygous infants for the p-198A and int2-180A variants had increased risk of IU (OR: 2.07 P = 0.045, OR: 3.78, P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (OR: 2.47, P = 0.17, O.R: 5.71, P = 0.025, respectively) HIV-1 infection compared to heterozygote infants or noncarriers (Table 3) . When adjustment was made for maternal factors, only the association with the int2-180A variant remained significant for IU (OR: 3.83, 95% CI = 1.42-10.4, P = 0.008) and IP (O.R: 5.71, 95% CI = 1.40-23.3, P = 0.025) HIV-1 transmission.',\n",
       "  'Thus, infants homozygous for DC-SIGNR variant int2-180A contained in H1 and H3 haplotypes were 4-fold to 6-fold more likely to be infected by HIV-1 during pregnancy or at delivery, respectively.Alternative splicing of the DC-SIGNR gene in the placenta produces both membrane-bound and soluble isoform repertoires  . The relative proportion of membrane bound and soluble DC-SIGNR could plausibly influence the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection  . We therefore hypothesized that the DC-SIGNR mutations associated with MTCT of HIV-1 would have an impact on both the level of DC-SIGNR expression and in the isoform repertoire produced. We investigated DC-SIGNR transcript expression in first-term placentas obtained after elective abortion.We cloned DC-SIGNR from placental tissues by RT-PCR from 3 homozygous H1 samples containing both the DC-SIGNR p-198AA and int2-180AA variants associated with HIV-1 transmission and 3 homozygous wild-type (WT) (p-198CC, int2-180GG) samples. Fifteen clones per sample were randomly selected for sequencing.',\n",
       "  'As expected, we found an extensive repertoire of DC-SIGNR transcripts in all samples with 9 to 16 different isoforms per individual. A total of 65 distinct transcripts were identified ( Figure S1 ), of which 3 were full-length transcripts. 64 of the sequenced clones contained a total of 69 amino acid substitutions with 3 new C termini and 2 premature stop codons. However, the diversity was mostly attributable to the entire deletion of exon 2 or exon 3 or to variations in the length of the neck region (exon 4) of DC-SIGNR. The deletion of exon 3 eliminates the trans-membrane domain of the protein and leads to the expression of soluble DC-SIGNR isoforms  . Interestingly, the abundance of membrane-bound isoforms in placental tissues of the H1 homozygotes appears to be lower than that observed in samples from WT individuals ( Figure S1 ).',\n",
       "  'The deletion of exon 3 was confirmed by sequencing and we hypothesize that the skipping of exon 3, could be due to the presence of the int2-180A mutation observed in infants with the H1 haplotype. In fact, this intron mutation is located 180 bp downstream from exon 3 and potentially modifies splicing events (Figure 2A ). We confirmed that the variation in transcript proportions seen between the two groups was also reflected at the level of mRNA expression in the placenta. To quantify membrane-bound vs soluble isoforms in placental samples from homozygous H1 and WT infants, we amplified the exon 5 (E5) sequence present in all DC-SIGNR isoforms (total transcripts). We then amplified exon 3 (E3) which is deleted in the soluble forms and then calculated the E3:E5 ratio.',\n",
       "  'We found that placental tissues from homozygous H1 infants express a significantly lower proportion of membrane-bound DC-SIGNR (18%) compared to that in WT individuals (36%) (P = 0.004) ( Figure 2B ) suggesting that exon 3 skipping happens more frequently in presence of the DC-SIGNR int2-180A variant associated with MTCT of HIV-1.The DC-SIGNR int2-180A variant is always transmitted with the promoter mutation p-198A (Figure 1 ). In the unadjusted regression analysis, the p-198A variant was significantly associated with IU but not with IP and PP HIV-1 transmission (Table 3) . Computational transcription factor binding site analysis predicts Table 1 . Baseline characteristics of mother and infants risk factors for intrauterine (IU), intrapartum (IP) and postpartum (PP) mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. Figure 3A ). The luciferase activity of the p-198A variant construct was significantly lower than that of the WT p-198C promoter construct (p-198C/A ratio = 2, P = 0.006) ( Figure 3B ) suggesting that DC-SIGNR p-198A affects promoter activity.',\n",
       "  'The other promoter mutants (p-577C and p-323A) observed in the Zimbabwean population did not affect DC-SIGNR transcription in this assay ( Figure S2 ). To determine the net impact of the DC-SIGNR p-198A mutation on DC-SIGNR expression in the placenta, we quantitated the absolute number of total and membrane-bound DC-SIGNR transcripts in the H1 homozygote and wild-type placental samples as described earlier. The total number of DC-SIGNR transcripts was determined to be 6856213 (DC-SIGNR copies6S.E.M per 10 5 GAPDH copies) in the placental samples from homozygous H1 infants and was 4-fold lower compared to that found in placentas from WT individuals (27816638, P = 0.011) ( Figure 3C ). As suggested earlier, the int2-180A mutation might induce exon 3 skipping leading to a lower production of membrane-bound DC-SIGNR.',\n",
       "  'Although, the decrease in the total number of DC-SIGNR transcripts in H1 homozygous placental samples containing both the p-198AA and int2-180AA variants affected the proportion of membrane-bound and soluble isoforms, the effect of these mutations was more pronounced on the membrane-bound isoforms with an 8-fold decrease (H1 = 117636.2 vs WT = 9906220.6, P = 0.003) compared to a 3-fold decrease in total soluble isoforms (H1 = 5686181.9 vs WT = 19256495.3, P = 0.03) ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, DC-SIGNR p-198A and int2-180A mutations associated with MTCT of HIV-1 significantly decreased the level of total placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the membrane-bound isoform production. Table 3 . Associations between infant DC-SIGNR promoter p-198 and intron 2 (int2)-180 variants and intrauterine (IU), intrapartum (IP) and postpartum (PP) mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. Our genetic results, supported by expression assay in placenta, suggest the involvement of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1.',\n",
       "  'Homozygosity for the haplotype H1 was associated with IU transmission in the unadjusted regression analysis. However, the association disappeared after adjustment was made for the maternal factors presumably because of the small number of H1 homozygote infants analysed in each groups. H1 and H3 were the most frequent haplotypes observed in the study population and they share a cluster of mutations (Figure 1 ). Grouping haplotypes H1 and H3 increased the power of the study and permitted the identification of specific DC-SIGNR mutations associated with MTCT of HIV-1. Indeed, two mutations shared by haplotypes H1 and H3 were associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1. The int2-180A was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of IU and 6fold increased risk of IP after adjustment for the maternal factors. Although the p-198A variant was associated with IU transmission, the association disappeared after adjustment was made for the maternal viral load.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, we showed that this mutation reduces DC-SIGNR transcriptional activity in vitro and produces lower level of DC-SIGNR transcripts in placental tissues in combination with the int2-180A variant. Since int2-180A is always transmitted with p-198A on the MTCT associated combined haplotypes H1/H3, whereas p-198A is carried on other nonassociated haplotypes (Figure 1) , we can speculate that the p-198A mutation alone may have a minor effect in vivo whereas in combination with the int2-180A variant, they both act to reduce the level of placental DC-SIGNR expression resulting in an increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1.The majority of IU transmission occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy (reviewed in  ). Full-term placenta samples were not available for the current study and the expression assays were performed on first-term placental tissues. A previous study looking at DC-SIGNR placental isoforms repertoire in full-term placenta samples demonstrated similar diversity of DC-SIGNR transcripts as in the first-term placental tissues studied herein  .',\n",
       "  'However, since levels of DC-SIGNR expression have never been compared between the different terms of pregnancy, it is not known whether DC-SIGNR expression varies during the course of pregnancy. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the inter-individual differences in both DC-SIGNR isoform repertoire and transcript levels observed between the H1 and WT homozygous infants would be reflected throughout the pregnancy. To date, most studies have focused on the potential role of DC-SIGNR in trans infection of HIV-1 in vitro [2, 10] . However, the multiple mechanisms involved in trans infection and redundancy among C-type lectin functions make it difficult to determine the actual participation of DC-SIGNR in this mode of infection in vivo [13, 14] . The strong correlation we observed between MTCT of HIV-1 and DC-SIGNR genetic variants producing low levels of DC-SIGNR in the placenta suggested that mechanisms other than DC-SIGNR-mediated trans infection might operate during vertical transmission of HIV-1.',\n",
       "  'For example, DC-SIGNR has also been shown to function as a HIV-1 antigen-capturing receptor  . Chan and colleagues recently demonstrated that DC-SIGNR transfected CHO cells diminish SARS-CoV titers by enhanced capture and degradation of the virus in a proteasome-dependent manner  . Since endothelial cells express MHC-I and II, degraded viral antigens could then be presented to immune cells to elicit an adaptive immune response [16, 17] . The HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5, but not CD4, is co-expressed with DC-SIGNR on placental and blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells [18, 19] . HIV-1 gp120 binding to CCR5 receptor on endothelial cells compromises BBB integrity and enhances monocytes adhesion and transmigration across the BBB [20, 21] . It is thus possible that reduced expression of DC-SIGNR, particularly the membranebound isoforms, on placental capillary endothelial cells might favour HIV-1 binding to CCR5 receptor, instead of DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier resulting in IU transmission of HIV-1.The int2-180A variant contained in the H1 and H3 haplotypes was associated with IP transmission suggesting that DC-SIGNR also affect transmission of HIV-1 during delivery.',\n",
       "  'Little is known about the mechanisms underlying transmission of HIV-1 during delivery. Passage through the birth canal could potentially expose infants through a mucosal portal entry (presumably ophthalmic, skin, or gastrointestinal), whereas placental insult during delivery (physical or inflammatory) may enhance transplacental passage of maternal HIV-1-infected cells into foetal circulation [22, 23] . Such process called microtransfusion has been proposed in regards to the results obtain in a Malawian cohort. Kweik and colleagues found a significant association between levels of maternal DNA in umbilical cord blood and IP transmission of HIV-1 suggesting that passage of maternal infected cells through the placenta is likely to occur during delivery  . Thus, in a similar fashion as suggested earlier for IU transmission, the relatively lower level of DC-SIGNR in the placenta of homozygous infants harbouring the int2-180A variant could promote HIV-1 binding to CCR5 receptor on endothelial cells affecting the placental barrier integrity and facilitating the passage of maternal infected cells in foetal circulation during delivery.Beside DC-SIGNR, other HIV-1 receptors are known to influence MTCT of HIV-1 (reviewed in  ).',\n",
       "  'Genetic variants in CCR5 have been shown to influence vertical transmission of HIV-1. CCR5 promoter variants resulting in higher expression of the receptor were associated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among sub-Saharan Africans [25, 26] . The 32-pb deletion polymorphism in CCR5 has be shown to protect from vertical transmission of HIV-1  , but this variant is virtually absent among African populations  . High copy numbers of CCL3L1, a potent HIV-1 suppressive ligand for CCR5, are associated with higher chemokine production and lower risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among South African infants [29, 30] . Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune receptor synthesised in the liver and secreted in the bloodstream in response to inflammation signal.',\n",
       "  'MBL promotes pathogen elimination by opsonization and phagocytosis, and reduced expression of MBL resulting from polymorphism in coding and non-coding regions has been associated with an increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 [31, 32] .In this study, we demonstrate for the first time, the potential functional impact of DC-SIGNR mutations on its expression in the placenta and in vertical transmission of HIV-1. We believe that the presence of DC-SIGNR at the placental endothelial cell surface may protect infants from HIV-1 infection by capturing virus and promoting its degradation/presentation. However, in placenta containing low levels of DC-SIGNR, HIV-1 would preferentially binds CCR5 on endothelial cells resulting in a loss of placental barrier integrity and enhanced passage of maternal HIV-1-infected cells in foetal circulation leading to MTCT of HIV-1. This mechanism may also apply to other vertically-transmitted pathogens known to interact with DC-SIGNR such as HIV-2, hepatitis C and dengue viruses and warrant further investigation.',\n",

       " ['Recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins, IFITM3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression.',\n",
       "  'Our investigations using an established reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule.',\n",
       "  'This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.Text: The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family (also known as the Fragilis family in mice) is a part of the dispanin family  and is composed of double-transmembrane α-helices connected by a cytoplasmic (CP) loop and extracellular (EC) amino-and carboxyl-terminal polypeptide sequences (Figure 1-A) . The IFITM proteins are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates  . Recent genomic research has revealed that there are 5 IFITM members in humans (IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10) and 7 members in mice (IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10). These proteins play roles in diverse biological processes, such as germ cell maturation during gastrulation (IFITM1-3)    , cell-to-cell adhesion (IFITM1)    , antiviral activity (IFITM1-3)          , and bone formation (IFITM5)      , although the detailed functions of IFITM6, 7, and 10 are unknown at present.',\n",
       "  'In particular, IFITM3 has been a target of intensive studies on its activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and internalization       .In 2010, Dr. Yount and co-workers reported that the antiviral activity of IFITM3 is dependent on S-palmitoylation on the protein  . The S-palmitoylation  is a post-translational modification on proteins by C 16 saturated-fatty acids (palmitic acids) covalently attached to certain cysteine residues via a thioester linkage (Figure 1-B) . The modification is reversibly catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, and confers unique properties to the protein, such as membrane binding and targeting, immunoreactivity,Amino-acid sequence alignment of IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 derived from mice. The conserved residues are highlighted in black. The three conserved cysteines are highlighted in red and numbered based on the sequence of IFITM5 (top) and IFITM3 (bottom). The residues unique in IFITM5 are highlighted in gray.',\n",

The TM domains were predicted by SOSUI. The aspartates at the C-terminal region in IFITM5 are shown in blue. B) The schematic illustration of the protein S-palmitoylation. The C 16 -palmitic acid is attached to cysteine via a thioester linkage. The palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, respectively. In this study, hydroxylamine, NH 2 OH, was used to reduce the thioester linkage. C) The amino acid sequence identity (similarity) among IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 is summarized. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0075831.g001 and protein-protein interaction. The authors revealed that IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on three membrane proximal cysteines, Cys71 and Cys72 in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain, and Cys105 in the CP loop (Figure 1-A)  .',\n",
       "  'In addition, IFITM3 lacking the S-palmitoylation is not clustered in the cell membrane and significantly diminishes the antiviral activity. Moreover, the cysteines in IFITM2, Cys70, Cys71, and Cys104 are also palmitoylated in the same manner, which affects the intracellular localization  . A resent study has revealed that murine IFITM1 has four cysteine residues (Cys49, Cys50, Cys83, and Cys103) for the S-palmitoylation, which is required for the antiviral activity and the protein stability  . The other IFITM family members also possess these cysteines (Figure 1-A) , and thus the role of the Spalmitoylation on the cysteines should be significant for the functions of IFITM proteins.Here, we focused on IFITM5, which is also known as bonerestricted IFITM-like (BRIL) protein  . Among the IFITM family proteins, IFITM5 is unique. (i) Expression of IFITM5: Unlike the other IFITM family proteins, the expression of IFITM5 is not induced by interferons because the region upstream of the ifitm5 gene lacks the interferon regulatory elements  .',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, the expression of IFITM5 is mostly restricted to osteoblast cells [18, 19, 27] , while the other IFITM proteins are expressed ubiquitously (ii). Amino-acid sequence similarity: The amino acid sequence of IFITM5 is relatively dissimilar to IFITM1-3 proteins (~ 65% similarity), while IFITM1-3 proteins share ~ 85% similarity with each other (Figure 1 -C). In addition, IFITM5 has an aspartate-rich domain in the C-terminal region, which could be involved in calcium binding (Figure 1 -A)  . (iii) Role of IFITM5 in bone formation: The expression of IFITM5 is associated with mineralization during the bone formation process in osteoblast cells     . Previous studies have confirmed the expression of IFITM5 in bone tissues in mice, rats, humans and tammar wallabies  . The ifitm5-gene knockout mice have smaller bones  . Moreover, the knockdown of the ifitm5 gene by small hairpin RNA induces a decrease in bone nodule formation, whereas overexpression of the gene in UMR106 cells has been shown to increase calcium uptake and bone nodule formation  .',\n",
       "  '(iv) Role of IFITM5 for immune activity: Recent studies have revealed that IFITM5 interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-the prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (FPRP) complex  . When the complex is formed, the expressions of 5 interferon-induced genes are induced, including bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (Bst2), interferon inducible protein 1 (Irgm), interferoninduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (Ifit3), b(2)microglobulin (B2m), and MHC class I antigen gene. Consequently, these results indicate that IFITM5 is involved not only in the bone formation but also in the immune system activity.In this study, we investigated the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 and its role in the interaction with FKBP11 in mouse osteoblast cells. Cells transfected by a plasmid DNA encoding mouse IFITM5 were grown in the presence of an established chemical reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) [29, 30] , or an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP)  .',\n",
       "  'The biochemical assays using these compounds revealed that the wild-type IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated. To identify the Spalmitoylation site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/C53A, and -C52A/53A/86A (Cys-less). The chemical reporter assay suggested that at least two out of three cysteines in IFITM5 are S-palmitoylated. The interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was examined by immunoprecipitation assay, resulting in the loss of the interaction in the presence of 2BP. The same result was obtained in the two mutants, C52A/C53A and Cys-less. These results suggested that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of IFITM5 is necessary for the interaction with FKBP11. On the other hand, Cys86 in the CP loop of IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated but not involved in the interaction. Because this interaction is important for the immunologically relevant gene expression, it was indicated that the role of the S-palmitoylation is to promote the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and to regulate the immune activity in the osteoblast cells.',\n",
       "  \"The possible interaction mechanism and the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the bone nodule formation will be discussed.For mammalian cell expression, plasmid vectors of wild-type IFITM5 (IFITM5-WT) and FLAG-fused FKBP11 (FKBP11-FLAG) were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into a pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan).

The standard staining procedure was used. The mineralized nodules were checked every three days.To identify the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5, the osteoblast cells harboring the plasmid DNA encoding IFITM5-WT were cultured in the absence and presence of 2BP, which inhibits the S-palmitoylation (Figure 2-A)  . Then, the cell lysate containing total protein was extracted for use in the SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses. For purposes of comparison, E. coli cells were also cultured in the absence of 2BP and the cell lysate was extracted.',\n",
       "  'Figure 2 -B shows the results of the western blot assay for IFITM5-WT expressed in the osteoblast and the E. coli cells. In the osteoblast cells, IFITM5-WT exhibited a single band near the 17.4 kDa molecular-mass marker (see lane 1) in the absence of 2BP. However, in the presence of 2BP (see lane 4), the band appeared at a lower position than that in the absence of 2BP (lane 1). These results suggested that IFITM5-WT has high and low molecular-mass forms in the absence and presence of 2BP, respectively. The S-palmitoylation is a reversible reaction, and therefore is depalmitoylated by a strong reductant such as hydroxylamine  . Following hydroxylamine treatment (see lane 2), the band appeared at the same position as in the presence of 2BP (lane 4). In prokaryote E. coli cells, the post-translational modification S-Palmitoylation on IFITM5 PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org does not occur.',\n",
       "  'Hence, the band was also observed at the same lower position (see lane 3). In the case of IFITM3, the palmitoylation was also reported to induce a change in mobility on electrophoresis, just as in our present results  .For direct observation of the S-palmitoylation, an established chemical reporter, 17-ODYA (Figure 2-C) , was used. The osteoblast cells harboring the plasmid encoding IFITM5-WT were cultured in the presence of 17-ODYA to label the protein metabolically. Following the extraction and the purification of the cell lysate, the labeled IFITM5-WT was ligated with TAMRA-azide according to the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] azidealkyne cycloaddition method [10, 29, 30, 32 ]. An in-gel fluorescence image of the 17-ODYA-TAMRA-labeled IFITM5-WT (see lane 2 in Figure 2 -D) showed that IFITM5 was Spalmitoylated in the osteoblast cells. The FLAG-tag attached to IFITM5 has no influence on the modification and chemical labeling (lanes 1 and 5).',\n",
       "  'In addition, after the hydroxylamine treatment (see lane 6), the fluorescence became weak because of the dissociation of 17-ODYA from IFITM5, which was the same mechanism as the dissociation of the palmitic acid from IFITM5 by reduction as described above (lane 2 of Figure 2-B) .Therefore, we concluded that the IFITM5 expressed in the native osteoblast cells is S-palmitoylated. In addition, the bands corresponding to the high and the low molecular-mass forms shown in western blot analysis were tentatively assigned to the S-palmitoylated and the depalmitoylated forms, respectively.As described above in the Introduction, cysteine residues are the substrate for S-palmitoylation. IFITM5 possesses three cysteines, Cys52 and Cys53 in the TM1 domain, and Cys86 in the CP loop (Figure 1-A) . All of these cysteines are highly conserved among the mammalian IFITM family proteins (Figure 3-A) . To identify the modification site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C52A/C53A, -C86A, and -C52A/C53A/C86A (Cys-less).',\n",

Figure 3 -B shows the results of the western blot detecting the expression of all the mutants in the osteoblast cells. In the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (see lanes 2 and 4), the low molecular-mass form was detected. This result indicates that either Cys52 or Cys53 is involved in the S-palmitoylation. In addition, as shown in Figure 2 -D, strong and weak fluorescence were detected in the C52A/ C53A mutant in the absence and presence of hydroxylamine (lanes 3 and 7) , respectively, but not in the Cys-less mutant (lanes 4 and 8) . These results suggested that the rest of the cysteine in the C52A/C53A mutant, Cys86, is S-palmitoylated and the Cys-less mutant completely lost the S-palmitoylation because all the cysteines were substituted.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, we concluded that Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated. In addition, it was found that the S-palmitoylation on the TM1 domain has a major effect on the mobility in the gel (lower panel of Figure 2 -D and Figure 3-B) . Therefore, we hereafter refer to the high and low molecular-mass forms as the TM1palmitoylated and the TM1-depalmitoylated forms, respectively. Finally, we reassigned the bands shown in the western blot analysis as follows: IFITM5-WT is fully palmitoylated, the C86A mutant is partially palmitoylated at Cys52 and/or Cys53, the C52A/C53A mutant is partially palmitoylated at Cys86, and the Cys-less mutant is completely depalmitoylated.Previous studies have revealed that IFITM5 interacts with FKBP11  . FKBP11 belongs to the FK506-binding protein family and has a transmembrane domain.',\n",
       "  'The interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 is important for the immune activity because formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex induces the expression of interferon-induced genesnamely, the Bst2, Irgm, Ifit3, B2m, and MHC class I antigen gene  . To investigate the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11, we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay. The osteoblast cells co-transfected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5-WT and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured in the absence and the presence of 2BP. Then, the extracted cell-lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose gel. The gel was washed several times. Finally, the proteins were competitively eluted by the addition of FLAG peptide.

Figure 4 -A shows the results of the western blot for the co-immunoprecipitation of IFITM5-WT with FKBP-FLAG. The band corresponding to FKBP11 appeared in all the lanes (upper panel).',\n",
       "  'Lanes 1 and 2 are controls to ensure that IFITM5 and FKBP11 are both contained in the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. The controls also ensured that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in the absence of 2BP (see lane 1), whereas IFITM5 was not S-palmitoylated in the presence of 2BP (see lane 2). After the immunoprecipitation, a single band corresponding to the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 appeared in the absence of 2BP (see lane 3), indicating the interaction of the Spalmitoylated IFITM5 with FKBP11. However, in the presence of 2BP, no band corresponding to IFITM5 appeared (see lane 4) , indicating that the two molecules do not interact with each other. These results suggest that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 contributes to the interaction with FKBP11.Next, we further investigated the relationship between the Spalmitoylation and the interaction with FKBP11 by using the IFITM5 mutants described above.',\n",
       "  'The osteoblast cells cotransfected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5 mutants (C52A/ C53A, C86A, and Cys-less) and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured.

Figure 4 -B shows the results of the western blot for the co-immunoprecipitation of the wild-type and the IFITM5 mutants with FKBP11. Figure 4 -C shows the results of the control experiment using the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. As described in the previous section 3-3, the band corresponding to FKBP11 appeared in all the lanes (upper panels) because the immunoprecipitation was carried out using the anti-FLAG agarose gel. In the lower panel of Figure 4 -B, single bands were observed for the IFITM5-WT and -C86A mutant (lanes 1 and 3) but not for the -C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (lanes 2 and 4) . This result indicates that the wild-type and the C86A mutant interact with FKBP11, whereas the other two mutants do not.',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, this tendency mirrored the trend for the S-palmitoylation profiles, which means that Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of the IFITM5-WT and -C86A mutants is S-palmitoylated, whereas these residues are not S-palmitoylated in the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (see Figures 2-D, 3 -B and the lower panel of Figure 4 -C). Because the S-palmitoylation contributes to the IFITM5-FKBP11 interaction, as described in the previous section 3-3 (also in Figure 4-A) , the results of Figure 4 -B suggest that the mutants which lost the S-palmitoylation site(s), Cys52 and/or Cys53, are not able to interact with FKBP11. In other words, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is necessary for the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11.As described above in the Introduction, previous studies have revealed that IFITM5 also contributes to bone formation     . Therefore, we investigated the influence of Spalmitoylation on the bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells, in which native IFITM5 is expressed.',\n",

The mineralized nodule was stained with Alizarin Red, which reacts with deposited calcium. In Figure 5 -D, the area of the mineralized nodule was plotted against experimental time. In the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-A, -C, and -D) , the mineralization was started 15 days after the initiation of the cell differentiation (Day 0). On the other hand, in the presence of 2BP ( Figure 5-B and -D) , the nodule was formed on Day 12. The halftime for the maximum mineralization in the presence of 2BP was estimated to be 7 days earlier than that in the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-D) .',\n",
       "  'In addition, differences in the form of the mineralized nodules were observed. Figure 5 -E shows an enlarged view of each nodule on Day 21. The stained nodules were diffused in the presence of 2BP (panel b), whereas in the absence of 2BP the nodules formed a large cluster (panels a and c). Therefore, our observations in this study suggested that the S-palmitoylation affects the bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells.In this study, we confirmed the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 in the osteoblast cells, which was the same as that previously reported for IFITM3 and IFITM2. As reported previously, in IFITM3 and IFITM2, which share 85% sequence similarity (Figure 1-C) , two cysteines in the TM1 domain (Cys71 and Cys72 for IFITM3, Cys70 and Cys71 for IFITM2) and one cysteine in the CP loop (Cys105 for IFITM3, Cys104 for IFITM2) are all S-palmitoylated in cells [10, 24] .',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, although IFITM5 shares 68% and 66% sequence similarity to IFITM3 and IFITM2, respectively, more than one cysteine in the TM1 domain (Cys52 or Cys53) and one cysteine in the CP loop (Cys86) are S-palmitoylated. Taking into account the high conservation of three cysteines in the IFITM proteins (Figures 1-A and 3-A) , all the cysteines in IFITM5 may be involved in the S-palmitoylation just as in the case of IFITM3 and IFITM2 [10, 24] .The roles of the S-palmitoylation on IFITM3 have been studied intensively, and the S-palmitoylation has been shown to be crucial for the correct positioning in the membrane and the resistance to viral infection and internalization  (the roles are summarized in Figure 6 -A and discussed in detail below). A recent study has revealed that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM2 is also important for the protein clustering in the membrane  .',\n",
       "  'However, we do not know the role of the Spalmitoylation of IFITM5 for the clustering in the membrane at present because we have not yet succeeded in obtaining a proper antibody for immunohistochemistry, despite our allocating much time to the search and considering a considerable number of antibodies.Dr. Hanagata and co-workers previously reported that IFITM5 lacking the TM1 domain and the CP loop, which and IFITM5 (lower panels), the anti-FLAG and the anti-IFITM5 antibodies were used as primary antibodies, respectively.

B) Western blot for the co-immunoprecipitation of the wild-type and the cysteine-substituted mutants of IFITM5 with FKBP11-FLAG in the osteoblast cells. The band corresponding to FLAG peptide is not shown because of the smaller molecular-mass of FLAG peptide relative to FKBP11-FLAG. C) The control experiment of Figure 4 -B used to verify that IFITM5 and FKBP11 were both present in the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. The experiment was repeated 2 times. A) The functional mechanism of IFITM3 is summarized from previous studies. (i) IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated at Cys71, Cys72, and Cys105, (ii) which induces clustering and correct positioning in the membrane, (iii) resulting in the antiviral activity against influenza virus. B) The functional mechanism of IFITM5 is summarized by combining the results from the present and the previous studies. (i) Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated (ii).',\n",
       "  'The S-palmitoylation allows IFITM5 to interact with FKBP11 in the osteoblast cells (iii). The dissociation of CD9 from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex is induced by formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex and leads to the immunologically relevant gene expression. IFITM5 also contributes to the bone formation, but it is unknown which states as described in (i)-(iii) are important for the bone formation at present.At present, no interactive protein has been identified in IFITM3 and IFITM2. On the other hand, IFITM5 interacts with the partner protein, FKBP11, and the S-palmitoylation clearly makes a significant contribution to the interaction. Therefore, IFITM5 forms a hetero-oligomer in the cell membrane for its physiological function.contain the relevant modification sites, lost the ability to interact with FKBP11  . In the present study, we determined that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain is necessary for the interaction.',\n",
       "  'From these results, we speculate that Cys52 and Cys53 face toward the interaction surface with FKBP11, and therefore IFITM5 and FKBP11 interact with each other through the palmitic acid(s) attached to the cysteine(s) (summarized in Figure 6 -B, discussed in detail later). Our investigation revealed that Cys86 is involved in the Spalmitoylation but does not contribute to the interaction with FKBP11. We speculate that some other residues in the CP loop located near the TM1 domain make some contribution to the interaction.Previous investigations also revealed that IFITM5 expressed in the heterologous fibroblast NIH3T3 cells exhibited direct interactions with CD81, the B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BCAP31), and the hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7 (HSD17b7). These three proteins bind to the IFITM5 without the S-palmitoylation (low molecular-mass form; see Figure 3 -b in ref  . and Figure 1 -B in ref  .). In the fibroblast cells, the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 is insufficient  .',\n",
       "  'These interactions are not observed in the native osteoblast cells, and therefore are nonspecific. Taking these facts into consideration, we speculate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the specific interaction with FKBP11 in the osteoblast cells.The role played by the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in immune activity of the osteoblast cells will be discussed by combining the results from the present and the previous studies. A specific interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 should be necessary to form the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex. CD81, also known as TAPA-1, is a member of the tetraspanin membrane protein family and a component of the B-cell coreceptor complex which mediates the B-cell signaling for immune responses. When forming this complex, CD9, a partner protein with CD81, dissociates from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex and consequently induces the osteoblastspecific expression of the interferon-induced genes, Bst2, Irgm, Ifit3, B2m, and the MHC class I antigen gene  .',\n",
       "  'If the Spalmitoylation-mediated specific interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 were lost, the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex would not be formed, and consequently the interferon-induced gene expression would be inhibited because CD9 would remain associated with the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex. In this respect, we speculate that IFITM5 is involved in the immune system activity in the osteoblast cells and the interaction of the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 with FKBP11 regulates the immune activity.In addition, it was suggested that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 contributes to the bone nodule formation, including morphology and time for mineralization, in the osteoblast cells ( Figure 5 ). It is difficult to conclude at present that the lack of the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 causes the diffusion of the bone nodules (panel b of Figure 5 -E); we can say, however, that IFITM5 will probably not be S-palmitoylated in the cells in the presence of 2BP.',\n",
       "  'While 2BP is commonly used as an inhibitor of palmitoylation, it also targets many metabolic enzymes [33, 34] . Thus, it is also difficult to interpret the results of the long-term incubation of the osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP. In any case, these are interesting and key observations in terms of clarifying the role played by the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in bone formation, and further studies are required. Figure 6 describes a possible mechanism of the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and the role of IFITM5 in the osteoblast cell function by means of a comparison with IFITM3. In the case of IFITM3, as shown in Figure 6 -A, the following are observed. (i) The three cysteines are all S-palmitoylated (ii). The S-palmitoylation leads to the clustering and the correct positioning of IFITM3 molecules in the membrane (iii). The Spalmitoylation and the following clustering are crucial for the resistance to the influenza virus.',\n",
       "  'When IFITM3 lacks the Spalmitoylation, the IFITM3 molecules do not cluster, which leads to the significant decrease in the antiviral activity.On the other hand, Figure 6 -B shows that the following observations are made in the case of IFITM5. (i) Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated (ii). The S-palmitoylated IFITM5 is able to interact specifically with FKBP11. The interaction is presumed to be mediated by the palmitic acid(s) attached to the cysteine(s) facing toward the interaction surface on FKBP11. Cys86 is involved in the S-palmitoylation but not in the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11. At present, however, little is known about the role of the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 for the localization in the membrane. When the S-palmitoylation affects the localization of IFITM5 as in the case of IFITM3  , the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 molecules should be localized in the membrane or the depalmitoylated molecules should be delocalized.',\n",
       "  'The loss of the interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 could be due to a relocalization of the depalmitoylated IFITM5 that prevents its association with FKBP11 (iii). The Spalmitoylated IFITM5 interacts with the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex through FKBP11, which induces the dissociation of CD9 from the complex and the expression of 5 immunologically relevant genes. Finally, IFITM5 forms the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex. It is unknown at present which of the three states (i)~(iii) illustrated in Figure 6 -B is important for the bone mineralization of the osteoblast cells. The lack of the S-palmitoylation influences the interaction with FKBP11, which could account for the following complex formation and gene expression. In addition, the bone nodule formation is also affected. Note that the role of the Spalmitoylation has been involved in the bone formation  .',\n",
       "  'It is indicated that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 plays roles not only for the regulation of the immune activity but also for the bone formation.In conclusion, we have revealed the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 and its role in the interaction with FKBP11. Not only the immune activity but also the bone mineralization in the osteoblast cells is affected by the S-palmitoylation. In general, the functional role of the S-palmitoylation is different for each protein  . For many proteins, the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycle is constitutive and regulated by enzymes. Based on the present results, it is difficult to address (i) whether the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 is constitutive or regulated, or (ii) when and where IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated in the osteoblast cells. Further studies are required and are currently underway.'],\n",

       " ['Following the successful cloning of receptor for SARS coronavirus a few years ago, Dr. Wenhui Li and colleagues raised attention again by publishing a possible receptor for hepatitis B virus in eLife. We will briefly review the significance of this finding and the future prospects of hepatitis B research.Text: Among the five hepatotropic hepatitis viruses, only hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) still wait for the development of an in vitro infection system in cell culture. One hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, HepaRG, can be infected at a modest efficiency after weeks of culture and induced differentiation  . Even primary human hepatocytes rapidly lose the capacity for HBV infection after brief cell culture. The HBV infection demands both intracellular and cell-surface factors. The intracellular requirements appear less stringent, as after transfection of HBV DNA into many HCC cell lines or mouse liver, which cannot be infected naturally, the viral genome is expressed and replicates actively.',\n",
       "  'Thus, the failure of HBV infection is considered largely to be due to strict restriction on the interaction between HBV virions and the cell membrane.The molecules on the cell membrane needed for HBV infection can be divided into two classes: low affinity and high affinity molecules. Among others, the heparan sulfates in the membrane proteins mediate the broad, but less specific, virus-cell interaction. However, the high affinity membrane partners for HBV remain elusive (the carboxypeptidase D found for duck hepatitis B virus may be the only serious contender  ).HBV envelope protein, namely the surface antigens, plays an essential role in the infection process. Both genetic and functional examination identified one domain in the Nterminus of HBV preS1 (amino acids 1-47) necessary for infection. This domain has been shown to function as a direct mediator for HBV by binding presumably cellular corresponding receptor(s)  .',\n",
       "  'More importantly, the myristoylated peptide is shown to effectively block HBV infection in primary human hepatocytes and in the human hepatocytechimera mouse at a nanomolar concentration  . In fact, a clinical trial testing the efficacy of this peptide in preventing HBV infection has been ongoing  . Clearly, this preS1 peptide can be a useful probe to pull out the interacting cellular factors, including specific viral receptors.Yan et al. have taken a reasonable approach to fish out possible HBV receptor(s)  . They engineered the first 2-47 amino acid peptide from PreS1 to increase its capacity to be cross-linked with proteins interacting with the cell membrane, without affecting its binding specificity. In order to obtain sufficient materials after cross-linking, they adopted the Tupaia hepatocytes, instead of human hepatocytes, for the experiments. The strategies actually brought down many membrane proteins, but in comparison with the negative control (homologous peptide without specific binding), they identified one cellular protein, NTCP (sodium taurocholate cotransporting peptide) by LC/MS/MS.',\n",
       "  'The same protein was pulled down from human hepatocytes as well. The authors further produced HCC cell lines stably expressing NTCP and subsequently infected them with HBV or HDV.Immunofluorescence staining clearly demonstrated the expression of HBV and HDV proteins in these cell lines, suggestive of a successful viral infection. In addition, they documented a 2-4-fold increase of viral RNA and DNA after infection in the cell line by real-time PCR. They also showed a Southern blot supporting the presence of HBV covalently closed circular DNA in the infected cell, a well-recognized marker for productive HBV infection. Finally, they identified a stretch of 10 amino acids in the NTCP transmembrane domain, as the motif directly interacting with the PreS1 peptide.NTCP is a transmembrane protein, usually located in the lateral surface (canalicular) of hepatocytes, which mediates bile acid transport  . Geographically, it is a good candidate for an HBV receptor.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, the authors could convert the cell lines previously non-permissible to HBV infection to permissible by over-expression of NTCP, again supporting its possible role in the HBV infection process. This can be a critical and long-awaited discovery toward understanding HBV receptors and establishing an experimental HBV infection system.Looking forward, we need to understand how NTCP interacts with both HBV envelope proteins and with other cellular proteins, especially through the motif embedded in the cell membrane. NTCP itself is not sufficient to allow HBV infection, as the majority of HepaRG cells were found to express NPCT but not to be infected  . NTCP might initiate or mediate molecular interactions that can overcome the cell-surface restrictions for viral entry. Such cooperative cellular or viral factors have to be discovered and demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of viral infection, at a level comparable to a natural one (hundreds or thousands fold viral amplification).',\n",
       "  'For example, the authors can use the NTCP-expressing cell lines as the starting materials to systemically identify other factors (maybe carboxypeptidase D) and make these cell lines more productive and permissive to HBV infection. In the near future, standard virological assays for HBV infections, including Northern or Western blots, are expected to demonstrate the successful HBV infections in vitro.The HBV research community has searched for HBV receptors for decades. Many candidates have been discovered and then discarded. The current study, however, took advantage of a well-documented viral peptide required for HBV entry in combination with a state-of-the-art proteomics platform. As a Chinese proverb says \"a thousand-mile journey starts from one incremental step\". As such, the identification of NTCP as a potential viral receptor for HBV may serve as an important initial step for this journey, leading to the development of an HBV infection system to facilitate the HBV research and hepatitis B treatment.'],\n",

Incubation of ELISA plates with biotinylated detecting antibody cocktails was performed in PBS (containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% FCS) at 37°C for 2 h. After washing, specific binding of the detecting antibodies was reported by streptavidin-HRP and stained with Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate (Thermo scientific, Rockford, USA) [11, 14, 15] .',\n",

The signal intensity and background of each spot was read out and recorded with \"Monster\"software. The positive signals were defined as a signal value > 400 and a signal value (sample)/signal value (negative) > 2.The identical antibodies used in the ELISA-array format were also tested in a conventional ELISA format to determine the difference in sensitivity and specificity of the two methods. The conventional ELISAs were performed at the same time as the ELISA-array assays to ensure similar reaction conditions. The conventional ELISAs were performed in an identical maner to the ELISA-array, except that antibodies were coated at a concentration of 2 μg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4), and substrate TMB was used instead of Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate [16, 17] .Three serum samples were collected from patients with nervous system symptoms and histories of tick bites.',\n",
       "  \"The serum samples were treated with penicillin and streptomycin, then inoculated into the allantoic cavities of chicken eggs. 3 days later, the liquid was collected and divided into two portions (one for inactivation and one for RNA extraction). The RNA and inactivated samples were stored at -70°C before use.RNA was extracted from the inoculated chicken eggs using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA extraction procedures were conducted at BSL-3 facilities. The primers and probes were used as previously described  . The real-time RT-PCR was conducted with a Quti-teck q-RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen Inc,). The reaction consisted of 10 μL of 2 × reaction buffer (0.2 μL reverse transcription enzyme, and 250 nmol/l primers and probes). RNA and deionized water were added to a final volume of 20 μl.\",\n",
       "  'PCR was performed with a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche, Switzerland)  .Optimization of the ELISA-array assayThe spotted array layout is depicted in Figure 1 and the efficacy of three different spotting buffers on the quality of the printed ELISA-arrays were investigated by spot morphology observation and signal intensity comparison.The spotting concentration of the capture antibodies varied from 0.2 to 0.0125 mg/ml (each was serially diluted 2-fold). The efficacy of the spotting concentration of the capture antibodies was evaluated by virus culture detection, the proper spotting concentration was determined by a combination of minimized cross reaction and higher signal intensity. Figure 1 illustrates the array layout and Figure 2 demonstrates the result of the three spotting buffers and spot concentration of antibody 2B5 by TBE virus culture detection.',\n",
       "  'Cross reaction detection was also conducted by applying JEV, YF, and DV cultures.Spot morphology observation (Figures 2a, b , and 2c) demonstrated that spotting buffer containing PBS with 20% glycerol produced tailed spot morphology; buffers containing PBS alone and PBS with 20% glycerol +0.004% Triton-X100 gave good spot morphology (round and full). Buffers containing PBS with 20% glycerol and PBS with 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100 produced higher signal intensities than PBS alone. Thus, PBS with 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100 was adopted as the optimized spotting buffer for subsequent experiments. Simultaneously, the spot concentration evaluation suggested that 0.05 mg/ml was optimal. At this concentration, the signal intensity was higher and the cross-reaction did not appear (Figure 2d ). Consequently, spotting concentration optimization of other capture antibodies (4D5, 1F1, 4E11, and 2B8) demonstrated that 0.05 mg/ml was also suitable(data not shown).The optimized ELISA array layout is shown in Figure 3 , which was applied in the following experiments.',\n",
       "  'Successful detection of viral pathogens requires a test with high sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate the performance of the designed antibody arrays, the specificity and sensitivity of the individual analytes were examined. By testing serially-diluted viral cultures, including DV-2, DV-4, JEV, TBE, SV, and EEEV, the sensitivity of ELISAarray and the identical conventional ELISA were compared ( Table 1 ). The detection limit of the two methods was compared and demonstrated. The cross-reactivity test was conducted using BHK-21 and vero cell lysate, Yellow fever virus (YFV) cultures (5 × 10 5 TCID 50 /ml, West Nile virus(WNV) cultures(2 × 10 6 TCID 50 /ml), and Western equine encephalitis virus(1 × 10 7 TCID 50 /ml). The results demonstrated that neither the ELISA-array nor traditional ELISA displayed cross-reactivity.Equal volumes of cultured TBEV, JEV, DV-2, DV-4, SV, and EEEV were prepared for single sample detection; two or three of the cultures were mixed for multiplex detection.',\n",
       "  'A cocktail of biotin conjugated antibody (2A10, 4E11, and 1F1) was used in all tests. The results demonstrated that for all virus combinations, each virus was detected specifically, with no false-positive or-negative results (Figures 4 and 5) .Chicken eggs inoculated with infected human serum were used for validation of the ELISA-array assay. All samples showed high reaction signals with capture antibody 2B5, which was specific for TBEV ( Figure 6b ). The ELISA-array assay suggested that the three patients were all infected with TBEV.To verify the results tested by ELISA-array, RNA extracted from chicken eggs was applied to a real time-RT-PCR assay using primers and probes targeting TBEV. The results were also positive (Figure 6a) . The consensus detection results confirmed that the ELISAarray assay was reliable.To be widely used in the clinical setting, the detection system should be easy to use and can be performed by untrained staff with little laboratory and experimental experience.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, when the volume of the clinical samples is limited and an increasing number of pathogens per sample needs to be tested, the detecting system should be high-throughput to allow detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously [6, 20, 21] . Multiple detection, easy to use, and affordability are requirements for detection methods in the clinical setting. Thus, an ELISA-array, which combines the advantages of ELISA and protein array, meets the above requirements.It has been reported that an ELISA-array has been used in the diagnosis of cancer and auto-allergic disease [7, 12] ; however, No study has reported the detection of viral pathogens. In this study, we developed a multiplex ELISA-based method in a double-antibody sandwich format for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis-associated viral pathogens.The production of a reliable antibody chip for identification of microorganisms requires careful screening of capture of antibodies  .',\n",
       "  'Cross-reactivity must be minimized and the affinity of the antibody is as important as the specificity. First, we prepared and screened 23 monoclonal antibodies against eight viruses and verified the specificity and affinity to the target viruses by an immunofluorescence assay. Then, the antibodies were screened by an ELISA-array with a double-antibody sandwich ELISA format. The antibodies which produced cross-reactivity and low-positive signals were excluded. Finally, six antibodies were selected as capture antibodies. Another monoclonal antibody, 2A10, which could specifically react with all viruses in the genus Flavivirus was used for detecting antibody against DV, JEV, and TBEV. For the detection of EEEV and SV, although the detecting and trapping antibodies were the same (1F1 and 4E11, respectively), the antibodies produced excellent positive signals. The epitope was not defined; however, we suspect that the antibodies both target the surface of the virions.',\n",
       "  'As one virion exits as, many with the same epitope appear, thus no interference occurred using the same antibody in the double-antibody sandwich format assay.Currently, the availability of antibodies suitable for an array format diagnostic assay is a major problem. In the ELISA-array assay, this problem exists as well. Because of the limitation of available antibodies, this assay could only detect 5 pathogens. In the future, with increasing numbers of suitable antibodies, especially specific antibodies against Flavivirus, this ELISAarray might be able to test more pathogens and be of greater potential use. To make the assay more amenable to multiple virus detection, the assay protocol was optimized. In addition to the dotting buffer, the capture antibody concentration and the different virus inactivation methods (heating and β-propiolactone) were also compared and evaluated. Heat inactivation was performed by heating the viral cultures at 56°C for 1 h, and β-propiolactone inactivation was performed by adding β-propiolactone into the retains better antigenicity than the heat-inactivation method.',\n",
       "  'Thus, β-propiolactone treatment was chosen as the virus-inactivation method. A conventional ELISA is a standard method in many diagnostic laboratories. We compared the ELISA-array with a conventional ELISA and confirmed that the advantage of the ELISA-array was evident with comparable specificity and higher sensitivity than ELISA. The time required for the ELISA-array is significantly less than for conventional ELISA (4 h vs. a minimum of 6 h, respectively). Furthermore, less IgG is required for printing than for coating ELISA plates. Coating of a single well in microtiter plate requires 100 μl of a 1 μg/ml antibody solution, which is equivalent to 100 ng of IgG. For the ELISA-array, only 30 nl of a 50 μg/ml antibody solution is required for each spot, which is equivalent to 1.5 ng of IgG. With the characteristics of ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, the ELISA-array assay would be widely accepted for clinical use.'],\n",
       " ['BACKGROUND: This paper reports findings from the prevalence survey conducted in Shandong China in 2010, a province with a population of 94 million. This study aimed to estimate TB prevalence of the province in 2010 in comparison with the 2000 survey; and to compare yields of TB cases from different case finding approaches. METHODS: A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multi-stage random cluster sampling. 54,279 adults participated in the survey with a response rate of 96%. Doctors interviewed and classified participants as suspected TB cases if they presented with persistent cough, abnormal chest X-ray (CXRAY), or both. Three sputum specimens of all suspected cases were collected and sent for smear microscopy and culture. RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 34 per 100,000 for adults in Shandong in 2010. Compared to the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough.',\n",
       "  'The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47% by symptom screening and 95% by CXRAY. Over 50% of TB cases were among over 65’s. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was significantly reduced compared with 2000. The survey raised challenges to identify TB cases without clear symptoms.Text: China, with an estimated prevalence of all TB cases of 108 per 100,000 in 2010, has the second highest TB burden in the world, accounting for 13% of all cases worldwide  . The World Health organization (WHO) estimated that China had reached the targets of 85% treatment success by 1993 and 70% case detection rate by 2005  . National TB prevalence surveys were conducted in China in 1979 China in , 1990 China in , 2000 , and 2010  . Survey results provide more accurate estimates for TB prevalence rates than the WHO estimates and can be used to assess the likelihood of China achieving global targets for TB prevalence.Shandong province has a population of 94 million.',\n",
       "  'It is a relatively developed province with a per capita GDP 1.6 times of the national average in 2010  . The prevalence rate of TB in Shandong was lower compared with the average rate of China in 2000  . Population representative samples were drawn in Shandong in the surveys of 2000 and 2010 using similar methods. The study aimed to estimate the TB prevalence in Shandong based on the 2010 survey, and compare results of the two cross sectional surveys.The target population of the TB prevalence survey was residents of 15 years old or above who had lived in the selected clusters for more than 6 months. A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multistage random cluster sampling method.The survey employed the same sampling methods as the China national survey in 2010, which was similar to the sampling methods used in 2000  .',\n",
       "  'The design of the surveys was in accordance with WHO recommendations  . The design effect factor due to cluster sampling was estimated at 1.28  . A sample size of 52500 adults (≧15 years old), in 35 clusters, was calculated based on detecting a change of 20% in prevalence rate of TB smear positive cases compared with the rate of the 2000 survey (95 per 100,000), with a probability greater than 95% and 95% power, accounting for 90% response rate of participants  .A stratified multi stage random sampling was used to select the 35 clusters within 17 prefectures in Shandong province. The number of clusters was randomly allocated in proportion to the provincial population at the prefectural, county/district and township levels. A cluster was defined as a community (a village in the rural area or a resident community in an urban area) with a population of 1250 to 1750 adults (i.e., those of 15 years or older).',\n",
       "  'If the community contained less than 1250 adult residents, the neighboring community to the north was annexed. If the community or combined communities containing more than 1750 adults, we randomly selected households and then included all adults in the household for the survey until the total number of selected adults reached 1750. Military barracks and prisons located in the cluster were excluded  .The survey was conducted from March to June 2010 by survey teams consisting of clinicians, public health doctors, radiologists, laboratory technicians and nurses. Local media was used to promote awareness of the survey. Community workers conducted a house-to-house census to update the database of residents, inform survey participants and obtain informed consent. The study did not involve children under 15 years old. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants of 16 years old or above. While from those of 15 years old, written informed consents were obtained from their parents or guardians.',\n",
       "  'All documents were properly stored in the Shandong Chest Hospital. Ethical approvals for the study and consent procedures were obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Shandong Chest Hospital (NIH register numberIRB00006010).Those who agreed to participate in the survey were invited to the county TB dispensary, where they completed a consultation with a trained clinical TB doctor regarding any symptoms suggestive of TB, such as persistent cough (lasting two weeks or longer), haemoptysis, weight loss and fever. All participants had a chest X-ray (CXRAY) taken that then were reviewed by a panel of radiologists. Those with symptoms or CXRAY films suggestive of TB were classified as suspected TB cases. All suspected cases were asked to produce three sputum samples, one at the time of consultation, another at night and the third in the early morning of the following day.',\n",
       "  'Identified suspects completed an additional questionnaire regarding their social-economic situation, smoking status, and the presence of TB related symptoms in the preceding six months (cough, fever, weight loss, chest pain and haemoptysis).Sputum smears were conducted in local TB dispensaries. All sputum samples were cultured using the Löwenstein-Jensen medium in the provincial laboratory within 24 hours using cold chain transportation. Samples were excluded from TB when non-tuberculosis bacilli were identified from the culture. All sputum smear and culture were conducted strictly according the national TB laboratory external quality control measure, which is in consistent with the WHO TB prevalence survey guideline  . TB classification was made according to the China national TB guideline  . A positive smear had at least one acid fast bacillus identified during examination of at least 100 fields. Participants with positive sputum smear specimens were classified as sputum positive cases.',\n",
       "  'Those with positive smear or culture sputum specimens were classified as sputum bacteriologically confirmed cases. Those being culture negative with abnormal CXRAY suggestive of TB and having been ruled out from other diseases by clinicians and radiologists were classified as CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases. Due to resource limitations the recommendation of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents to confirm the diagnosis of negative TB cases was not applied in this survey  . Newly diagnosed cases were distinguished from previously diagnosed cases through checks during the interviews and against the TB registration system. Initial diagnosis was made by a group of local clinicians and radiologists. Subsequently, samples and CXRAY films of all suspected and confirmed cases were re-assessed by a group of senior clinicians and radiologists at provincial and national levels. CXRAY films of 100% of those scored as abnormal and 10% random sampling of those scored as normal were transferred for independent reading.',\n",
       "  \"The provincial laboratory team randomly examined one slide from the three samples of sputum positive cases, all three samples of CXRAY suggestive TB cases, and randomly selected 10% of the non-TB cases.Prevalence estimates of sputum positive, bacteriologically confirmed and all TB cases were calculated. In all analyses, population weightings were employed to adjust for the stratified multi-stage sampling design effect  . The survey results in 2010 and 2000 were standardized against the age structures of China's census population in 2010. The 2000 TB prevalence survey included all age groups  . The WHO recommended method was used to enable comparison between the two surveys that prevalence rates of child TB were assumed to reduce to the same extent as adult TB from 2000 to 2010  . Subgroup analysis in gender, age groups and urban/rural residence were conducted. Case identification rate was calculated as the number of cases identified by a screening method over all suspected cases found by the method.\",\n",

It covered a total population of 89,093, of which 56,671 were eligible for the survey (Figure 1 ). The response rate ranged from 95% to 97% in different clusters. 54,279 participants attended clinical consultation and were examined by CXRAY. Among them, 47% were males. The average age was 46 years with 14% of 65 years and older. A total of 572 suspected TB cases were found. Of these, 264 (46%) were identified based on CXRAY abnormalities, 228 (40%) were based on persistent cough, 80 (14%) were based on both. The survey diagnosed 172 new cases, including 19 new bacteriologically confirmed cases (including 11 sputum and culture positive cases, and 8 sputum negative but culture positive cases) and 153 CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases.',\n",
       "  'The survey also identified 11 existing cases registered on the national TB program. In addition, the survey found four cases with culture positive non-tuberculosis bacilli, and excluded them from TB patients.All participants of the survey were first screened by symptoms and CXRAY. Those who had symptoms of consistent cough or haemoptysis, or CXRAY abnormalities were then screened by smear and culture. Case identification rates of new bacteriologically confirmed cases from the suspected cases were significantly higher with CXRAY as a primary tool (Figure 1 , 3.8%, P = 0.012) and further increased by both symptom screen of persistent cough and CXRAY (10%, P < 0.001) compared with symptom screen alone (0.4%). The same pattern of case identification rate was observed in the sputum positive cases (7.5%, 1.9% and 0% respectively). The proportion reporting persistent cough was not significantly higher among bacteriologically confirmed cases compared with other suspects (P = 0.565).',\n",

Among the 344 suspects with CXRAY abnormalities, 11 (3.2%) had sputum positive TB and 18 (5.2%) had bacteriologically confirmed TB. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47.4% by screening consultation and 94.7% by CXRAY. In the population of over 65 years old, symptom consultation and the CXRAY identified 174 and 182 suspected cases respectively, yielding5 (2.9%) and 9 (4.9%) of bacteriologically confirmed cases. Yields of bacteriologically confirmed cases were 55.6% by symptom consultation and 100% by CXRAY among over 65's.Of the 512 suspected cases that completed the additional questionnaire, 42% were farmers and 31% were current smokers (Table 1) . Per capita household income of bacteriologically confirmed cases was less than 50% of that of the non-TB cases (P < 0.05).\",\n",
       "  'Though smoking rate was higher among TB cases compared with non-TB cases, no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). Of the ten bacteriologically confirmed cases not presenting with persistent cough at the prevalence survey, one coughed for two days, one had chest pain, and the other eight had no symptoms of TB in the last six months.The crude prevalence rate in Shandong in 2010 of sputum positive cases was 22.1 (95% CI: 9.6-34.6), bacteriologically confirmed cases was 36.8 (95% CI: 17.8-55.8), and all cases were 337.1 (95% CI: 254.1-420.0) per 100,000 in adult population ( Table 2 ). The adjusted prevalence rates of the whole population in Shandong were17.8 (95% CI: 8.3-17.5), 27.8 (95% CI: 14.8-28.0) and 239.4 (95% CI: 179.9-298.9) per 100,000 in 2010. A remarkable decline of 82.0%, 80.2% and 31.4% was observed in TB prevalence rates of sputum positive, bacteriologically confirmed, and all cases, respectively, compared to the adjusted rates in 2000  .',\n",
       "  \"Large declines were observed in males between 40 and 65 years old, and in females over 60 years old ( Figure 2) .The adjusted prevalence rates in the adult population were 21.4 (95% CI: 10.0-32.8), 33.5 (95% CI: 17.8-49.2) and 285.8 (95% CI: 254.2-356.4) for sputum positive cases, bacteriologically confirmed cases and all cases, respectively. Significant differences regarding adjusted TB prevalence rates were observed between males and females, over 65's and 15 to 64 years old, in rural and urban areas ( Table 2 , P < 0.001). The male to female ratios were 5.5 in sputum positive cases and 2.8 in bacteriologically confirmed cases, while the ratios climbed to 6.0 and 4.1, respectively, among those over 65 years. The majority of TB patients, 54.5% of sputum positive cases and 47.3% of bacteriologically confirmed cases, were from people 65 years or older.\",\n",
       "  \"The ratio between over 65's and 15 to 64 years old was 8.4 in sputum positive cases and 5.9 in bacteriologically confirmed cases. The ratio between rural and urban areas was 2.7 in sputum positive cases and 4.8 in bacteriologically confirmed cases.The most striking finding was that a large proportion of TB patients did not present consistent cough. Passive case finding is the routine practice in developing countries where sputum microscopy is performed to identify TB cases among people with persistent cough. A large proportion of TB cases may be missed using this method as 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases and 45% sputum positive cases in this study had no persistent cough but were identified through abnormal CXRAY. Nearly half of bacteriologically confirmed cases reported no symptoms in the last six months. This finding, although initially surprising, is consistent with reports from Vietnam (47% of bacteriologically confirmed cases not presenting persistent cough)  , Myanmar (38%) and Ethiopia (48%)  .\",\n",
       "  \"CXRAY was sensitive in detecting TB cases, as yields of bacteriologically confirmed cases were much higher by CXRAY compared with by symptom screening, as reported in Vietnam  and some high HIV prevalence settings [16, 17] . CXRAY, though expensive at the initial installment, may improve TB case finding due to its short turnover time and high throughput  . Our findings suggest that the strategy of case finding using CXRAY followed by sputum or culture as the primary and secondary screening tests could be more effective, especially among the population of over 65 year olds, as the yields were higher in over 65's compared with the general Table 2 Prevalence rates of sputum positive TB cases, bacteriologically confirmed TB cases and all cases in Shandong, China, 2010 No population. Although using CXRAY to examine everyone is not feasible, it can be used in routine elder physical examinations.\",\n",
       "  'The China public health package now covers free CXRAY for elders, as well annual employee body examinations provided free CXRAY.In this survey, only one sputum positive patient had been detected and treated by the national program, though specific clinical consultation was conducted to identify any patients who have been diagnosed and treated for TB before. This may reflect the difference between the active case finding approach in the survey and the passive casing finding approach in practice. Nevertheless, it indicated that a large proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases are missed by the national TB program.Another notable change is the sharp decline of the proportion of sputum positive cases, which accounted for 30.5% of all cases in the 2000 survey but was reduced to 6.6% in the 2010 survey.',\n",
       "  \"The proportion of notified sputum cases out of all TB cases in Shandong also declined from 80.9% in 2005 to 64.6% in 2010  .The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases has reduced by 80% in the last decade in Shandong, compared with a national decline of 45% (from 216/ 100,000 in 2000 to 119/ 100,000 in 2010)  . The rapid decline of TB prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases in the recent decade may be attributed to China's strengthened public health system following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003  . Another reason may be due to improved reporting of TB cases in the online communicable disease reporting system, and the improved collaboration between public hospitals and TB dispensaries  . Other factors such as social economic development may also have played an important role in the reduction of TB prevalence, as found in a study of TB notification rates trends in 134 countries  .The adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases in Shandong was lower than the WHO estimates for China in 2010  .\",\n",
       "  \"But the national prevalence rates of bacteriologically confirmed cases, 119/100,000 in 2010  , was higher than the WHO estimate, 108/ 100,000, even the survey did not collect negative and extra-pulmonary TB cases. Vietnam reported similar findings in its 2006 survey  . One reason is that prevalence surveys results are based on active case finding while WHO estimates are based on notification rates from passive case finding. A re-evaluation of the reported TB prevalence in China is needed based on the recent survey.CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases may be smear or culture negative TB cases if they had any TB symptoms, while some may be caused by suboptimal smear or culture. As reported in China's previous surveys [3, 22] , including these cases as TB cases may result in an over-estimate of all pulmonary cases  .The survey revealed that over half of the TB patients were 65 years and older in Shandong, while the over 65's were more likely to present with abnormal CXRAY and persistent cough.\",\n",
       "  \"Similar trends have been documented in other developed cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore  . These high rates may reflect the higher TB rates in the past and decline in immunity in the over 65's. How to treat elders with TB and other complications such as diabetes remains an ongoing challenge in China and similar settings.The survey results can be generalized to the Shandong population of 94 million or similar international settings with middle income and middle TB prevalence levels. The patterns of the TB epidemic found in Shandong, i.e., the proportion of patients with symptoms, ratios between urban and rural areas, men and women, were similar to those found in the national survey  . However, the prevalence rates cannot be extrapolated to western provinces in China with a higher TB prevalence. For logistical reasons, the eligible population did not include adults staying in the sampled clusters less than 6 months, which was the same practice in the 2000 survey.\",\n",
       "  'However, shortterm migrants may have a potentially higher prevalence of TB than the general population  . This may result in a lower estimate of the true prevalence rate. The survey did not collect social-economic indicators, smoking status and HIV status of all participants, so comparisons between TB cases and all non-TB patients are not available. However, the HIV prevalence in Shandong China is below 0.01%, and would not significantly alter the TB prevalence rate. In addition, the survey did not evaluate child TB and extra pulmonary TB. Discussions of using CXRAY as a screening tool was on the technical aspect, but not on costing side as we did not conduct any cost effectiveness analysis or the social willingness to pay for such a strategy in similar settings.This study has shown that the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB in Shandong has reduced substantially over the last decade.',\n",
       "  'Importantly, the majority of these cases did not present with persistent cough and the proportion of sputum positive cases has declined sharply. Further studies are recommended to assess the feasibility of adopting CXRAY in the existing health care services to detect TB cases and the cost effectiveness of such intervention. The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],\n",

Novel cysteine protease inhibitors derived from 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine representing pharmacologically important class of compounds are being reported here for the first time. The derivatives were initially designed and screened in silico by molecular docking studies against papain to explore the possible mode of action. The molecular interaction between the compounds and cysteine protease (papain) was found to be very similar to the interactions observed with the respective epoxide inhibitor (E-64c) of papain. Subsequently, compounds were synthesized to validate their efficacy in wet lab experiments. When characterized kinetically, these compounds show their K(i) and IC(50) values in the range of 13.75 to 99.30 µM and 13.40 to 96.50 µM, respectively.

This has been shown to occur in infections with several microbial species, including Pseudomonas, Serratia, Clostridium, Candida, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Staphylococcus sp.  . Many bacteria secrete several nonspecific proteases e.g. Pseudomonas, Serratia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Bacteroides sp. have potent metallo-, cysteine and serine proteases with broad ranges of activities  .

The key role of cysteine proteases in microbial infections, coupled with the relative lack of redundancy compared to mammalian systems has made microbial proteases attractive targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutic approaches [10, 11] .Imidazopyridine ring systems represent an important class of compounds not only for their theoretical interest but also from a pharmacological point of view.

Molecular docking study provided the structural insight into the binding of these compounds (3a-j) (Figure 1 ) within the active site of papain which mainly consist of a catalytic triad of Cys 25, His 159 and Asp 175  . Moreover, role of other residues present in the active site of papain, playing important role in the accommodation of compounds have also been revealed.\",\n",
       "  'Initially, docking was performed with all the designed compounds (3a-j) against papain, a known cysteine protease enzyme and in this context, we observed very interesting results where our proposed inhibitors (3a-j) take advantage of aromatic and hydrophilic residues by making a variety of interactions with target enzyme. Although, compounds 3e-j gave significant results when docked with papain but during evaluation of antibacterial properties in wet lab experiments, they gave insignificant results (data not shown). Therefore, only four compounds were considered for discussion and further experiments like kinetic and thermodynamic studies to characterize these compounds as potent pro-inhibitors, were performed (3a-d).The findings of the above study have shown that the molecular interactions between the compounds 3a-d and papain were very similar to the interactions observed for E-64c, a derivative of naturally occurring epoxide inhibitor (E-64c) (Figure 1 ) of cysteine proteases [31, 32] , with papain; especially with regard to the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of the ligands with conserved residues in the catalytic binding site (Figure 2 A-D).',\n",
       "  'Several papain residues participated in hydrophobic interactions with compounds 3a-d, including Gln19, Cys25, Gly66 and Asp158. The pyridine moieties of compounds 3a-d interact with S2 site of papain which includes (Tyr61, Asn64, Gly65 & Tyr67) amino acids (Figure 2 A-D) . The active site residues that were found to be key player in the interaction of compounds within the active site (mostly through hydrophobic interactions) were Cys25, Tyr61, His159 and Trp177, while Trp177, Gln19 were found to me making hydrogen bonds only with compound 3a. Besides this many other residues were also found to be actively involved ( Table 1) .

This confirmed the accuracy of our docking protocol.',\n",

Interestingly, the observed in silico binding energies for the compounds 3a-d against papain were found to be in great agreement (standard error 62 Kcal/mol) with the value of free energy of binding (DG) observed during thermodynamics studies ( Table 1 and 2) . Similarly, enthalpy change (DH) of the binding was negative whereas entropy (DS) change of the binding was positive which indicated the exothermic and entropically driven nature of binding.',\n",
       "  \"This pattern of temperature dependence is characteristic of hydrophobic interaction  . As discussed earlier that all the compounds (3a-d) were found to interact with the active site residues of papain through hydrophobic interactions at most instances during in silico studies, the same was observed by the analysis of Van't Hoff plots for all the proposed inhibitors at three different temperatures (32uC, 37uC and 42uC) in wet lab experiments ( Figure 3) . This proves the importance of these types of interactions in the positioning of compounds within the active site. Hence, thermodynamics as well as in silico study reveals that hydrophobic interactions favor binding of these proposed inhibitors with papain like cysteine proteases. Further wet lab results proposed the non competitive interaction of compounds (3a, 3c & 3d) with papain except for compound 3b which showed competitive interaction.\",\n",

All the compounds strictly followed the pattern of antiprotease activity towards bacterial growth except P. vulgaris and E. coli at one instance each (Table 4) .

       " ['RNA interference (RNAi) is rapidly becoming an important method for analyzing gene functions in many eukaryotes and holds promise for the development of therapeutic gene silencing. The induction of RNAi relies on small silencing RNAs, which affect specific messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Two types of small RNA molecules, i.e. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are central to RNAi. Drug discovery studies and novel treatments of siRNAs are currently targeting a wide range of diseases, including various viral infections and cancers. Lung diseases in general are attractive targets for siRNA therapeutics because of their lethality and prevalence. In addition, the lung is anatomically accessible to therapeutic agents via the intrapulmonary route. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play an important role in lung abnormalities, such as inflammation and oncogenesis. Therefore, miRNAs are being targeted for therapeutic purposes.',\n",
       "  'In this review, we present strategies for RNAi delivery and discuss the current state-of-the-art RNAi-based therapeutics for various lung diseases.Text: traditional surgery, Bivas-Benita et al. reported that no mortality occurred as a result of the use of the endotracheal technique. Endotracheal applications are currently being used by many practitioners in the pulmonary field [22, 34] ; this is useful for studying pulmonary drug delivery in mice. However, the approach is more complex in humans because an artificial path for the delivery of drugs into the lungs is used. Therefore, the method is being used in animal models to test and evaluate its reliability for possible clinical applications. Intratracheal route: under anesthesia, the trachea is exposed surgically, and a tube or needle is inserted through an incision made between the tracheal rings. Complications, such as vascular injury and air leakage, are possible due to the tracheotomy.',\n",
       "  '(b) Endotracheal route: siRNAs are sprayed directly from the mouth into the lungs using a MicroSprayer ® aerolizer (Penn-Century, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and a laryngoscope. It is important to maintain a clear view of the trachea during the procedure.Intranasal delivery is another common method of pulmonary drug application in animal studies. In many studies, in vivo success has been demonstrated in delivering siRNAs to the lungs intranasally [22, 35, 36 ]. An experimental setup of intranasal delivery by spray or droplet is simple and painless for the animal. Although the success in delivering siRNAs intranasally in rodents cannot be completely extrapolated to human use because of the significant differences in lung anatomy  , this approach has potential for the clinical application of siRNAs.',\n",
       "  'Phase II clinical trials have been initiated for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, making use of intranasal application of naked chemically modified siRNA molecules that target viral gene products [17, 38] (see Section 3.1.1. for details).Intranasal entry has long been used to administer small molecules, such as proteins, for systemic delivery. Because the nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, delivery of a thin epithelium of medication across the surface area can result in rapid absorption of the medication into the blood. Therefore, siRNAs administered intranasally might be deposited in the nose, and some of them may be unable to reach the lower respiratory tract. In fact, it has been reported that intranasal application of unformulated siRNAs resulted in lower delivery efficiency and homogeneous pulmonary distribution than that achieved with intratracheal application  . The intranasal method is suitable for some lung diseases, such as upper respiratory infection by RSV, and it also has potential for systemic delivery rather than pulmonary delivery of siRNAs.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, it is important to consider the route of administration in animal studies when assessing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of a formulation for pulmonary delivery. Careful choice of efficient delivery in response to the condition of lung diseases is necessary.The use of aerosols to deliver medication to the lungs has a long history. Administration by inhalation is a popular and non-invasive method of delivering agents into the lungs. There are several inhalation devices available for the delivery of drugs into the lungs. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are the most common modes of inhaled delivery. MDIs are the most commonly used inhalers for several lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a spacer is an external device that is attached to an MDI to allow for better drug delivery by enhanced actuation and inhalation coordination.',\n",
       "  'For most MDIs, the propellant is one or more gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Although CFCs in drugs are safe for patients to inhale, they are harmful to the environment. Therefore, further development of inhalable siRNAs may not be the best way forward. DPIs are devices that deliver medication to the lungs in the form of dry powder. The use of DPIs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin  and low-molecular-weight heparin  ; thus, it could be a better device for delivering siRNAs to the lungs. The advantages of DPIs are improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols and propellant-free formation.Although drugs are commonly delivered to the lungs by inhalation, most in vivo studies using siRNAs have relied on intratracheal or intranasal delivery. The reason could be the difficulty in formulating inhalable siRNAs and maintaining the stability during the delivery process.',\n",
       "  'A suitable carrier is also needed to protect nucleic acids from degradation due to shear force and increased temperature during the drying process. The use of spray-drying as a technique for engineering dry powder formulations of siRNA nanoparticles, which might enable the local delivery of biologically active siRNA directly to the lung tissue, has been demonstrated [24, 25] . In the future, the technique is desirable to estimate the in vivo study on siRNA therapy for inhalation. In the long term, we anticipate that there will be more sophisticated devices for clinical use and that those currently being developed will be more suitable.There are two main barriers to efficient pulmonary siRNA delivery to the cells of the lung. The first is the complex, branched anatomy of the lungs and biomechanical barriers, such as the mucus layer covering the airway cells [41, 42] (Figure 2) .',\n",
       "  \"A remarkable feature of the respiratory tract is its high degree of branching. Airway consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. All of these structures bear alveoli, the tiny air sacs in which the gas exchange takes place. It is generally acknowledged that the critical factor for efficient siRNA delivery depends on the properties of RNAi drug particles in terms of size, charge, shape, velocity and density. For efficient pulmonary siRNA delivery, the particles must be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. Deposition in the airway is affected by the particle size and patient's pulmonary function. A particle size between 1-5 μm is found to be the most appropriate for deposition at the lower respiratory tract  . In addition, the presence of mucus and surfactant proteins, the mucociliary clearance actions, and phagocytosis by macrophages present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery.\",\n",
       "  'Therefore, delivery systems usually require delivery vectors, and these vectors need to be designed in order to maximize the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the respiratory tract. Besides, the extracellular barriers to siRNA delivery also depend on physiological features of the respiratory tract, which may change with the disease stage and characteristics of the patient. At the active stage of lung disease, the physiological conditions of the airways might change and have significant impact on the efficiency of the pulmonary delivery system. During infection, inflammation, and allergic reaction, there is an increase in mucus secretion along with the impaired mucociliary clearance  . Moreover, asthma and COPD are both chronic inflammatory conditions of the lung associated with structural \"remodeling\" that is inappropriate to the maintenance of normal lung function  . The airway wall thickness, the high viscosity, and the composition of the mucus layer might be altered in patients who have inflammatory lung diseases.',\n",
       "  'Figure 2 . Extracellular barriers to pulmonary siRNA delivery. The anatomical feature of the respiratory tract is its high degree of branching. The mucus lines the respiratory epithelium from the nasal cavity to the terminal bronchioles. The deposited particles on the ciliated epithelial cells are rapidly cleared by the mucociliary clearance actions. Mucus and mucociliary clearance of mucus-trapped particles is a pulmonary defense mechanism as a physiological barrier. In the alveolar, clara cells and type II alveolar cells secrete on the surface of the alveolar epithelium, forming a thin layer of pulmonary surfactants. The surfactants act as the main barrier for siRNA delivery because they reduce the transfection efficiency. In addition, the macrophages located in the alveoli rapidly engulf the foreign particles by phagocytosis. The particles taken up into the macrophages are subsequently degraded inside the cells. These factors present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery.The second is the airway cell membrance and its intracellular barriers ( Figure 3 ).',\n",
       "  'For efficient gene silencing in the lungs, siRNAs must be delivered to their site of action, be stable, enter the target cells, and be present in the cytoplasm at sufficient concentration. Once the siRNAs reach the target cells, they must be trafficked into the cytoplasm and taken up by Argonaute (Ago)2/RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which degrades mRNAs and, subsequently, suppresses the sequence-specific gene expression. For efficient endocytosis to occur, particles should be under 150 nm in size. Particles within this size range could also avoid macrophage uptake and delayed lung clearance  . The physicochemical properties of siRNAs also play a significant role in crossing the biological membrane. Despite their small size, the negative charge and chemical degradability of siRNA molecules prevent them from readily crossing biological membranes. Therefore, efficient siRNA delivery approaches need to overcome this limitation by facilitating cellular uptake.',\n",
       "  'One of the main functions of a delivery vector is to facilitate the cellular uptake of siRNAs  . The electrostatic complexation of siRNA molecules with cationic lipids and polymers helps to mask their net negative charge. The positively charged siRNA carrier complex interacts with anionic proteoglycans on the cell membrance, forms an endocytic vesicle, and enters the cells by endocytosis  . After cellular internalization, the siRNA carrier complex in endocytic vesicles is transported along microtubules to lysosomes that are co-localized with the microtubule-organizing center. To avoid lysosomal degradation, siRNAs must escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm, where they can associate with the RNAi machinery. Endosomal escape is a major barrier for efficient siRNA delivery [48, 49] . The endosomal entrapment and lysosomal degradation of siRNA and carriers contribute to the low transfection efficiency and is a major difficulty for delivery vectors.',\n",
       "  'An ideal delivery agent should protect siRNAs from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and promote endosomal escape inside the cells with negligible toxicity.Multiple approaches for the delivery of siRNAs have been reported, ranging from the relatively simple direct administration of saline-formulated siRNAs to lipid-based and polymer-based nanoparticle approaches and siRNA conjugation and complexation approaches  . The negative charge and chemical degradability of siRNAs under physiologically relevant conditions make its delivery a major challenge. Accordingly, the delivery of siRNAs usually requires a vector or carriers for their transfection into the target cells. In general, both viral and non-viral vectors are being assessed for siRNA delivery to lung cells. Some viral vectors, such as retroviruses and adenoviruses, have been demonstrated to mediate gene silencing in an in vitro lung model  and to induce RNAi in a range of animal tissues  . Recently, Guo et al.',\n",
       "  'showed that lentivirus-mediated siRNA was used to specifically knock down the expression of nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) in vivo, which resulted in inhibited tumor growth  . However, viral-based delivery has several disadvantages. The immune response to viruses not only impedes gene delivery but also has the potential to cause severe complications  . Recent well-documented cases, such as the death of Jesse Gelsinger due to complications related with an adenoviral delivery vector, highlight this problem  . In addition, some viral vectors may insert their genome at random positions in the host chromosome, which eventually restrict the gene function  . . Intracellular barriers to pulmonary siRNA delivery. Barriers to cellular internalization are dependent on the surface properties of siRNA and carriers (e.g., charge and size). After siRNAs are successfully taken into the target cells by endocytosis, the main barriers for delivering siRNAs to its site of action are the endosomal entrapment and lysosomal degradation of siRNA and carriers.',\n",
       "  'To direct target-gene silencing, the siRNAs need to escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm, where they associate with the Ago2/RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to direct the cleavage of mRNAs bearing complementary binding sites.As an alternative to viral vectors, non-viral vectors, including lipid and polymer-based vectors, have been generally used for the delivery of siRNAs to the lungs due to their reduced toxicity  . Ongoing research into the transfection of primary cells and whole organisms with siRNA using non-viral transfection agents has produced some promising results. Lipid-based delivery vectors are successfully used to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo  . Cationic lipids are composed of positively charged head, a linker and hydrophobic. In general, lipid-based complexes are easy to formulate and good transfection efficacy is achieved due to interaction with negative charged cell membrance. Many commercial siRNA transfection agents are lipid-based delivery system, some of which are also employed for pulmonary delivery-DharmFECT  , Oligofectamine  , Lipofectamine  and TransIT-TKO  .',\n",
       "  'Similarly, cationic polymers have also been assessed for siRNA delivery to lung cells. Cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) is widely used for siRNA delivery [13, 61] . PEI is considered as the gold standard for in vitro gene delivery and its transfection efficiency depends on the molecular weight and degree of branching.On the other hand, lipid-based vectors can also induce toxicity and non-specific activation of inflammatory cytokine and interferon responses [62, 63] . Although polymer-based vectors elicit a relatively less strong immune response than lipid-based vectors, effective siRNA delivery to a local area in lung diseases requires more attention to the development of non-toxic delivery vectors. An important point for siRNA-mediated inhibition of gene expression is whether the observed effects are specific rather than due to off-target effects and free from potential interferon responses [64, 65] .',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, some studies have shown that it was possible to administer \"naked siRNAs\" to mice and down-regulate an endogenous or exogenous target without inducing an interferon response  .The term \"naked siRNAs\" refers to the delivery of siRNAs without any delivery vectors. Naked siRNAs are degraded by serum endonucleases and are usually removed by glomerular filtration, resulting in a short plasma half-life of < 10 min. Thus, some studies of systemic delivery of naked siRNAs have failed to achieve the downregulation of the targeted gene [67, 68] . In contrast, there have also been some successes of locally delivering naked siRNAs to the lungs [15, 16, 20, 31] . A few of them reported that the use of delivery vectors showed no significant difference in gene silencing efficiency compared to that of naked siRNAs [16, 35] . Indeed, in one clinical trial, the delivery of naked siRNAs for the treatment of RSV has been used [17, 38] .',\n",
       "  'This successful evidence can be because that naked siRNAs for clinical applications are highly chemically modified to prevent nuclease-induced degradation and presumably minimize immune stimulatory effects. Although it is unclear how the naked siRNAs cross the cell membrane, gain access to the cytoplasm, and remain intact to perform their biological action, both animal and human trials have been conducted successfully, showing the efficacy of naked siRNAs (ALN-RSV01) that were administered intranasally. This explanation has not been confirmed, but the physiological damage of respiratory epithelial cells caused by viral infection may have possibly influenced the mystery. The active change in airway epithelial cell membrance caused by infectious disease might affect cellular internalization. Naked siRNA delivery has some advantages, such as simple formation and the absence of toxicity or inflammatory responses that are usually associated with delivery vectors. Nevertheless, the advantage of naked siRNAs over delivery vectors in the treatment of lung diseases is controversial [69, 70] .',\n",
       "  'Further in vivo investigations about both naked siRNAs and non-viral vectors are required.Lung disease is a major cause of death, and diminished quality of life is responsible for the suffering of many patients. Various lung diseases make life extremely difficult for the patients, and severe cases of these lung diseases can result in death. The high death rates associated with lung cancer are partially due to the fact that it is unfortunately difficult to cure. Above all, COPD is the fourth-leading cause of death in most industrialized countries and is predicted to become third by 2020  . Therefore, decisive action is needed to stem the rising health and economic burden this represents. Chronic lung diseases, such as COPD and asthma, are disorders of the airways largely related to the presence of persistent inflammation. The approval of inhaled corticosteroids pioneered a new generation of therapy in treating chronic inflammatory diseases.',\n",
       "  'This was the first time that an anti-inflammatory product was available to reduce the characteristic lung inflammation in airways and the associated obstruction. Corticosteroids are still an important therapeutic intervention. However, they are used with limitations in COPD and moderate to severe asthma. Likewise, the treatment of various refractory lung diseases also depends on systemic corticosteroid therapy. Many of these patients also suffered various side effects from systemic corticosteroid use, such as weight gain and uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Treatment of lung disease using cell-specific targeting as well as RNAi techniques represents a novel strategy and could possibly provide new opportunities in nanomedicine. Pulmonary applications of siRNA in in vivo conditions are frequently studied and often result in clinical trials [57, 72] . The findings of recent clinical studies of pulmonary RNAi therapeutics are discussed.Since the discovery of RNAi, the therapeutic potential of siRNAs has been rapidly recognized.',\n",
       "  'In 2004, the first human clinical trial of RNAi-based therapy was initiated for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration with a siRNA targeting VEGF-receptor 1 delivered intravitreally  . Many studies have been conducted over the past few years that involve the delivery of siRNAs to the lungs for the treatment of various lung diseases. Delivery to the lungs will be most important to moving siRNA technology into the clinic. A number of siRNA-based therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of different conditions, including lung diseases such as asthma and RSV infection. Table 1 is a summary of clinical trials of siRNA-based therapeutics  . SiRNA shows potential for the treatment of various pulmonary viral infections, and it has been reported that siRNA-based therapeutics can also be used in the treatment of influenza  , parainfluenza virus  , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  , and RSV  .',\n",
       "  'Above all, RSV is the most promising therapeutic target of siRNAs.RSV is a common cause of serious respiratory infections in infants and children. It also produces significant morbidity and mortality in adult immunocompromised or elderly populations  . An RSV vaccine is not available, and the only approved antiviral therapy for RSV is undesirable for pediatric patients due to its potential teratogenicity and limited effectiveness. Thus, a safe and efficacious RSV therapy has long been awaited for both pediatric and adult patients. RNAi-based therapy has shown promising effects in murine models of RSV infection  . The siRNA, ALN-RSV01, is directed against the mRNA encoding the N-protein of RSV that exhibits specific in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity. It is delivered without a delivery vector as a nasal spray and targets the upper respiratory tract instead of the lower lung area.',\n",
       "  'ALN-RSV01 has undergone complete phase I intranasal and inhalation studies in healthy adults and has been found to be generally well tolerated  . Additionally, ALN-RSV01 has been evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial in lung transplant patients with RSV respiratory tract infection  . The administration of ALN-RSV01 to RSV infected lung transplant patients was safe and well tolerated and associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms. Based on these results, a larger multinational, randomized, double-blind Phase IIb trial of ALN-RSV01 has been initiated in lung transplant patients to confirm and extend these findings.Cancer is a major target of RNAi-based therapy, as oncogenes, mutated tumor suppressor genes, and several other genes contributing to tumor progression are potentially important targets for gene silencing by RNAi. Lung cancer is one of the most frequent tumors worldwide with regard to incidence rates and mortality.',\n",
       "  'Patients with lung cancer are commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease and have limited therapeutic options. Although the knowledge regarding the genetic and molecular basis of lung cancer has regularly increased, the median survival rates of individuals with advanced lung cancer are still poor.RNAi-based therapy is an attractive strategy for the development of more effective anticancer therapies with reduced treatment-related toxicity. The major advantage of RNAi therapeutics in cancer might be the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes belonging to different cellular pathways that are involved in tumor progression. The simultaneously inhibition of several genes would also minimize the risk of drug resistance normally encountered with small molecule-based therapies, involving siRNAs and miRNAs. There have already been significant improvements in siRNAs for primary or metastatic lung cancer treatment by targeting oncogenes such as Akt1  , Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)  , overexpressed genes such as the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R)  , NUPR1  and EZH2  .',\n",
       "  'Some of these studies have successfully shown the efficacy of RNAi-based therapy through intrapulmonary administration of siRNAs with non-viral vectors. Although strategies to minimize off-target and nonspecific immune stimulatory effects must be devised, these data suggest that the silencing of the target gene with siRNAs is an attractive strategy for the prevention and treatment of primary and metastatic lung cancer. There are currently some clinical trials in progress estimating the safety and efficacy of siRNA-based drugs for cancer treatment. Atu027, a siRNA-lipoplex targeted against protein kinase N3 (PKN3), prevented lung metastasis in a phase I trial of various cancer models  . PKN3 is a downstream effector of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway  , which regulates diverse cellular responses, including development, growth, and survival  . Recently, PKN3 has also been considered as a suitable therapeutic target for modulating tumor angiogenesis because loss of function analysis with Atu027 in cultured primary endothelial cells showed an essential role of PKN3 for endothelial tube formation and migration  .',\n",
       "  'Atu027 can be considered as a potential siRNA for preventing lung metastasis and might be suitable for preventing hematogenous metastasis combined with conventional cancer therapy.Inflammatory lung disease, also called COPD, includes a wide range of lung ailments. These related diseases include asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic bronchitis. They are influenced by a combination of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic components  . COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. This disease is hallmarked by airflow that is not fully reversible. Systemic and local airway inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD  . COPD is mainly associated with tobacco smoking, and recent studies investigating the pathophysiology of emphysema have demonstrated that cigarette smoke can cause cells to enter cellular senescence.Smoking might cause cells to senesce due to DNA damage through increased cell turnover, which in turn leads to accelerated telomere shortening  .',\n",
       "  'Lately, a lot of studies have investigated the role of cellular senescence in the development and progression of COPD  . Although several medication classes, including inhaled corticosteroids, are used for COPD treatment, none of these medications have been shown to significantly improve long-term lung function during the progression of the disease. Current interventions that have been shown to improve mortality in COPD are cessation of smoking and delivery of supplemental oxygen when hypoxemia is present.Many people are developing COPD, and the cause of this condition is complicated and not thoroughly understood. One key factor is genetic susceptibility. Some studies have shown a large genetic contribution to the variability in pulmonary function and COPD [86, 87] . Polymorphisms in multiple genes have been reported to be associated with COPD  , such as transcription factor [e.g. nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB)]  , extracellular matrix (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12)) [89, 90] , cytokines [e.g.',\n",
       "  'tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α]  , chemokines [e.g. interleukins (IL)-8, IL-8 receptor and chemokine receptor (CCR)1] [92, 93] , and apoptosis (e.g., caspase-3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) [94, 95] . Many of these have been identified as possible targets for therapeutic intervention using molecule inhibitors or antagonists. Although several new treatments that target the inflammatory process are now in clinical development, such as TNF-α inhibitors and I-kappaB kinase complex 2 (IKK2) inhibitors [96, 97] , clinical trials with siRNAs have never been performed in COPD. The delay of drug development for COPD might be due to the relatively recent emergence of research addressing the molecular basis of COPD. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the essential molecular mechanisms about the pathogenesis of COPD and to develop monitoring techniques to support the development of RNAi therapies. Currently, no available treatments reduce the progression of COPD or suppress the inflammation in small airways and lung parenchyma.',\n",
       "  'The RNAi-based approach for the key molecules also has potential implications for the treatment of COPD.Asthma is also a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction. The World Health Organization estimates that 300 million people are currently affected and that, by the year 2025, another 100 million will be affected by the disease  . Inhaled corticosteroids are very effective in mild asthma because they improve symptoms and decrease exacerbations. However, in moderate and severe asthma, inhaled corticosteroids have important therapeutic limitations. Although corticosteroids remain an important therapeutic intervention for inflammatory lung diseases, their use is not always completely effective and is associated with side effects. Due to such limitations, it is clear that there is a need for new types of medications that can treat and improve the prognosis of moderate to severe asthma.Many target genes have been identified that participate in the pathogenesis of asthma.',\n",
       "  'The most promising targets include genes coding for cytokines (IL-4, IL5, and IL-13), cytokine and chemokine receptors (IL-4 receptor and CCR3), and tyrosine kinases [spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and LCK/YES-related novel tyrosine kinase (Lyn)], as well as for transcription factors [signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT6, GATA3, and NFκB] that are involved in asthma [19, 99, 100] . The genes that have been assessed as siRNA targets for the treatment of asthma in preclinical models are reported  . Currently, in a clinical trial for asthma, Excellair TM (ZaBeCor, Bala Cynwyd, PA, USA), a siRNA that targets Syk, is being used. The kinase is involved in signaling from a B cell receptor and is a key regulator of downstream signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of several pro-inflammatory transcription factors. It has been reported that antisense oligonucleotides administered by aerosol were potent to decrease Syk expression, mediator release from alveolar macrophages, and Syk-dependent pulmonary inflammation  .',\n",
       "  \"Moreover, inhibition of inflammatory mediators was shown in a study using siRNA targeting Syk in airway epithelial cells  . Following the successful results of the company's Phase I clinical trial, a Phase II trial for its asthma drug candidate Excellair TM has already been initiated. Some of the current treatments for asthma and other inflammatory conditions, such as TNF-α inhibitors or leukotriene inhibitors, inhibit only one of the mediators of inflammation. In contrast, siRNA targeting Syk seeks to inhibit an initial signaling step of inflammation and, thereby, prevent the release of multiple inflammatory mediators. Overall, recent progress of siRNAs to the lungs has also improved the therapeutic feasibility of RNAi for inflammatory lung diseases. The rapid progress will put siRNA-based therapeutics on a fast track to the clinic.MiRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by repressing translation or promoting the degradation of their target mRNA.\",\n",
       "  'MiRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs and mediating mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. In the human genome, transcripts of approximately 60% of all mRNAs are estimated to be targeted by miRNAs  . According to their function, miRNAs play an important role in cellular processes as development, proliferation, and apoptosis of pulmonary pathologies  . A growing number of miRNAs have been shown to be involved in different lung diseases. This evidence makes miRNAs a promising technology for current and future therapeutic development. We discuss the role of some miRNAs in various lung diseases as well as the possible future of these discoveries in clinical applications. Table 2 shows the summary of miRNAs in therapeutic development. At this point, a miRNA-based therapy has already entered a phase II clinical trial.',\n",
       "  'There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for lung homeostasis and, thus, may contribute to the development of pathological pulmonary conditions. Many studies have focused on the role of miRNAs in inflammatory lung diseases, such as COPD [116, 117] , pulmonary fibrosis     , and asthma     (Table 3) . [117, 129] The pathogenesis of COPD is attributed to not only chronic inflammation in the airways but also systemic inflammation  . Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the development of COPD.Smoking has been shown to cause biological change in the gene expression of the lungs  , and there are some reports about smoking-related miRNAs [117, 129, 130] . However, there are few reports that focus on the miRNAs related to the pathogenesis of this disease with systemic inflammatory components. Recent study on pulmonary fibroblasts of COPD patients presents less expression of miR-146a after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines when compared with non-COPD subjects with similar smoking histories  .',\n",
       "  'The downregulation of miR-146a resulted in a prolonged mRNA half-life of cyclooxygenase-2, thus increasing prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts from COPD subjects.Moreover, Ezzie et al. researched the difference of miRNA profiles expressed in the lungs of smokers with and without COPD. They concluded that miR-223 and miR-1274a were the most affected miRNAs in subjects with COPD  . Yet, COPD is a complex, multi-component, and heterogeneous disorder with a number of different pathological processes and subgroups with their own characteristics and natural history  . A better understanding of the complexity of the disease and potential clinical relevance of the identified miRNAs is needed.Pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by an identifiable irritation to the lungs, but, in many cases, the cause is unknown, and the therapeutic possibilities are limited. Cigarette smoking is one of the most recognized risk factors for the development of pulmonary fibrosis.',\n",
       "  'This disorder is mainly accompanied by increased expression of the key fibrotic mediator transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and other cytokines produced at the lesion of active fibrosis  . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play an important regulatory role in the pulmonary fibrotic change in the lungs. The downregulation of let-7d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in increased collagen deposition and alveolar septal thickening  . In addition, Liu et al. reported that the oncogenic miR-21 was found to be upregulated in IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis  . Although these miRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets because their expression is related to the regulation of TGF-β, the factor is necessary but not sufficient for pathologic fibrosis of the lungs. Pulmonary fibrosis is also a complicated illness that can have many different causes.Focus on the role of miRNAs in asthma has recently increased.',\n",
       "  'Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airway that is characterized by an abnormal response of T helper-2 (Th2)-type CD4+T lymphocytes against inhaled allergens  . In a different asthmatic mouse model, there was an observed increase in the expression of miR-21 in the lungs  . This report might contribute to the understanding of the inflammatory mechanism in the airway through the inhibition of IL-12, favoring the Th2 lymphocyte response. A toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced Th2 lymphocyte induces high expression of miR-126, and selective blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype  . In addition, airway remodeling is a characteristic feature of asthma and has important functional implications. Rodriguez et al. have shown that miR-155 is related to the development of inflammatory infiltration into the lung and airway remodeling  . Thus, some studies present a functional connection between miRNA expression and asthma pathogenesis and suggest that targeting miRNAs in the airways may lead to anti-inflammatory treatments for allergic asthma.',\n",
       "  'Despite the evidence from experimental models, the expression profiling of miRNAs in airway biopsies from patients with mild asthma before and after treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and in healthy volunteers revealed no differences in miRNA expression  . Further investigations about the role of miRNAs related to asthma pathogenesis are required.Although the basic evidence of miRNA biology is still providing new insights, applications of miRNA-based therapy for inflammatory lung diseases are less advanced than those for lung cancer  . One reason for this could be that the disease heterogeneity is caused by the effects of many environmental air pollutants, including smoke and volatile organic compounds. The presence of several risk factors makes the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases complicated.',\n",
       "  'Understanding the role that miRNAs play in the modulation of gene expression, leading to sustain the pathogenesis of lung diseases, is important for the development of new therapies that focus on the prevention of disease progression and symptom relief.Given the significant roles that miRNAs play in multiple pathways of lung carcinogenesis, increasing efforts are dedicated to the research and development of miRNA-based therapies, including restoring functions of tumor suppressive miRNAs or inhibiting oncogenic miRNAs. The development of miRNA-based therapies for lung cancer is growing prosperously with the help of new RNAi technologies. Compared to siRNA-based therapies, which are already in clinical trials, miRNAs are less toxic and have the potential to target multiple genes. The difficulty associated with miRNA delivery is mainly equal to that of siRNAs. The critical problems for the development of this therapy are effective delivery into target sites, potency of the therapy, and elimination of off-target effects  .There are two strategies as the therapeutic applications of miRNAs for lung cancer  .',\n",
       "  'One strategy is miRNA replacement therapy, which involves the re-introduction of a tumor suppressor miRNA mimic to restore a loss of the function. MiRNA mimics are synthetic RNA duplexes designed to mimic the endogenous functions of miRNAs with chemical modifications for stability and cellular uptake. The concept of miRNA replacement therapy is most exemplified by the let-7 miRNA. let-7 is a tumor-suppressor miRNA in non-small-cell lung cancer that inversely correlates with the expression of the RAS oncoprotein, a key cancer gene  . Intranasal administration of let-7 mimic into mouse models of lung cancer significantly reduced tumor growth, suggesting that miRNA replacement therapy is indeed promising [106, 140, 141] . Another miRNA that shows the value of miRNA replacement is provided by miR-34a [107, 142] . Local and/or systemic delivery of a synthetic miR-34a mimic led to accumulation of miR-34a in the tumor tissue and inhibition of lung tumor growth.',\n",
       "  'Lately, Ling et al. also showed that tumor suppressor miR-22 exhibited anti-lung cancer activity through post-transcriptional regulation of ErbB3  . Thus, therapeutic miRNA mimics have a powerful potential by attacking multiple genes relevant to several diseases. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the potential toxicity in normal tissues under conditions in which the therapeutic delivery of miRNA mimics will lead to an accumulation of exogenous miRNAs in normal cells  . Although the assumptions are well founded, there is still insufficient evidence for toxicity caused by miRNA mimics. Indeed, several in vivo studies failed to reveal side effects caused by the miRNA mimics and suggested that delivery of miRNA mimics to normal tissues was well tolerated [107, 141] . It will be important to research miRNA mimic-induced effects in normal cells and to carefully assess toxicity before using them in clinical practice.The second strategy is directed toward a gain of function and aims to inhibit oncomiRs by using anti-miRNAs.',\n",
       "  'Chemical modifications, such as 2\\'-O-methyl-group and locked nucleic acid (LNA), would increase oligo stability against nucleases  . Antisense oligonucleotides contained in these modifications are termed antagomirs or \"LNA-antimiRs\" [144, 145] . They are oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to the endogenous miRNA and inhibit the specific miRNA function. An LNA-antimiR against miR-122 has been shown to effectively silence miR-122 in non-human primates  , and the findings support the potential of these compounds as a new class of therapeutics. Moreover, it has also been reported that anti-miR-150 delivered into lung tumor xenografts in mice led to inhibited tumor growth  . Relative to studies on miRNA mimics, studies with antisense oligonucleotides have shown effective evidence with naked oligonucleotides. This illustrates the potential of chemical modifications of oligonucleotides to improve their stability, resistance to RNase, and pharmacologic properties. Therefore, inhibition of miRNA function by chemically modified antimiR oligonucleotides has become an important and widely used approach.',\n",
       "  'Recent data from the first phase II study in patients with chronic HCV infection treated with the LNA-modified antimiR-122 showed that this compound was well tolerated and provided continuing viral suppression.An increasing number of studies have examined the therapeutic potential of miRNAs. Recently, the evidence of roles for miRNAs in determining drug resistance has emerged  . Cytotoxic and molecular target drugs have been widely used in the treatment of advanced lung cancer; unfortunately, many cases are still refractory to chemotherapy. In this situation, combining miRNA mimics or antimiR with chemotherapy may potentiate the efficacy of the cancer treatment in the future. In addition, miRNAs related with cancer stem cells may significantly broaden the field of miRNA-based therapy and suggest that miRNAs can be potential tools to kill cancer cells associated with therapy resistance, recurrence, and metastasis [108, 148] .',\n",
       "  'Hence, the main challenge is the successful delivery and chemical modifications of the therapeutic miRNAs to the target tissue without harming normal tissues.RNAi-based approaches provide a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of various lung diseases. One of the greatest challenges in RNAi-based therapy continues to be the delivery method of the therapeutic siRNAs and miRNAs to the target cells. Pulmonary delivery applications are very attractive, since they tend to be non-invasive, are locally restricted, and can be administered by the patient. A realistic therapeutic intervention, such as aerosolization, can enhance drug delivery to the site of action and decrease systemic exposure of the patient to the therapy, thereby reducing off-target effects. The advancement of pulmonary siRNA delivery to the clinic illustrates that RNAi-based therapy holds a central place in the future treatment of lung diseases.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, miRNAs have the opportunity to target multiple genes in a fine-tuned manner, and the miRNA-based therapy will provide an attractive anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory approach for various lung diseases. In particular, anti-miRNA therapy by chemically modified antimiR oligonucleotides has become a potential therapy for lung diseases because the oligonucleotides can be successfully delivered without delivery vectors. Increased evidence has indicated that miRNAs fulfill causative roles in a variety of lung diseases and have prompted investigations into their potential as therapeutic targets. Further understanding of the detailed mechanisms of RNAi-based therapy and investigations of more effective delivery methods are required for future development. These novel approaches could open new avenues for various lung diseases and improve the clinical outcome of the patients.'],\n",

It is an enveloped, unsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and has a genome of approximately 27.6 kb (2) . Recently, many epidemiological analysis reports have suggested that nephropathogenic IBVs have become increasingly prevalent (3) (4) (5) (6) in China. In this work, the complete genome sequence of an isolate named SAIBK was analyzed and recombination was detected between SAIBK and some previously reported IBVs.A rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (TaKaRa, Japan) was used to obtain the 5= and 3= ends of the genome.',\n",
       "  'Other parts were amplified by 19 primers with overlap between each fragment and were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan). All fragments were sequenced three times by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The sequenced fragments were assembled using the SeqMan software program (DNAStar, Inc.). Sequence alignment was conducted and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the software program MEGA5 (7). Recombination analysis was performed using the RDP 4.14 (8) and SimPlot 3.5.1 (9) software programs.The complete genome of the SAIBK strain is 27,534 nucleotides (nt) in length, including the poly(A) tail.

The S1 subunit of the IBV genome is the major determinant of serotype (10) (11) (12) (13) , and S1 analysis indicated that the SAIBK strain has a 4/91-like serotype.The employed recombination detection methods revealed that SAIBK is a chimera virus, with recombination by the SC021202 strain as a major parent and the H120 vaccine strain as a minor parent. The first and second recombination regions were located at positions 7231 to 9126 and 13437 to 14473 in genes 1a and 1b, respectively.',\n",

The recombination detection results suggested that SAIBK is possibly a chimera virus derived from the popularly used vaccine strains H120 and H52 and the field strain SC021202, and the SC021202 strain was isolated from chickens vaccinated with H120 in the Sichuan province of China in 2003 (14) .

Limited data are available in China to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small–medium cities and rural areas. OBJECTIVES: To determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children, a 3-year study was conducted in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from eligible children were collected. Influenza and other respiratory viruses were tested by molecular assays simultaneously. Data were analyzed to describe the frequency and seasonality. RESULTS: Of the 2025 children enrolled in the study, 971 (48·0%) were positive for at least one viral pathogen, in which 890 (91·7%) were <4 years of age. The three most prevalent viruses were influenza A (IAV; 35·8%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 30·5%) and human rhinovirus (HRV; 21·5%). Co-infections were found in 302 cases (31·1%), and dual viral infection was dominant.',\n",

On the whole, the obvious seasonal peaks mainly from March to May were observed with peak strength varying from 1 year to another. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a basic profile of the epidemiology of acute respiratory viral infection in hospitalized children in Shenzhen. The spectrum of viruses in the study site is similar to that in other places, but the seasonality is closely related to geographic position, different from that in big cities in northern China and neighboring Hong Kong.Text: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a persistent and pervasive public health problem in both developed and developing countries.

Especially in developing countries including China, ARTIs, mainly pneumonia, are the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 years.',\n",
       "  '1,2 A great variety of pathogens can cause ARTIs, and viruses have been considered as the predominant pathogens in this children population. 3, 4 The most frequently reported viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (ADV), which are responsible for most episodes of ARTIs in children. 1 In the past decade, several new viruses associated with ARTIs such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), novel strains of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HKUI), human bocavirus (BOV), WU polyomavirus (WUPoyV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPoyV) have been discovered in human respiratory tract specimens. Among them, some have been identified to be causative pathogens of ARTIs. 1, 4, 5 Currently, there are no approved vaccines or medications available for most of the respiratory viruses. 1 A better understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in children plays a key role for the prevention, control and treatment of ARTIs.',\n",
       "  'Studies showed that many viral respiratory infections exhibited predictable seasonal variations. However, the epidemiological profiles of viral respiratory infections from different climate zones or different countries in the same climate zone may be varied. China is a large country crossing three climate zones, and great differences in climate are found from region to region. A better understanding of the epidemiology of ARTIs in different regions could be helpful to develop effective surveillance, prevention and treatment strategies. Although some studies on the epidemiology of ARTIs have recently been reported in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong,     the epidemic characteristics of viruses in ARTIs are still not well established all around China, especially in other cities and rural areas.Shenzhen is the largest migratory city of China with high population density and population mobility. It is located in southern China at 22°27 0 -22°52 0 N and 113°46 0 -114°37 0 E, immediately north of Hong Kong, with a typical subtropical monsoon climate.',\n",
       "  \"The annual average temperature and relative humidity of Shenzhen are about 23°C (12-33°C) and 77%, respectively. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence, seasonality and clinical characteristics of acute viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children in Shenzhen and to provide insights into etiologies of ARTIs in local infants and children.A consecutive 3-year prospective study from July 2007 to June 2010 was conducted in Shenzhen, a coastal city neighboring Hong Kong. Four hospitals including a children's hospital were chosen for the study. Selected patients with ARTIs admitted to the pediatric wards were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were as follows: less than 14 years old, acute fever (T ≥ 38°C), with any one of respiratory symptoms (such as sore throat, cough, wheezing and dyspnoea/ tachypnoea), normal or low leukocyte count, the onset of illness within 3 days before hospitalization.\",\n",
       "  \"The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on the guideline of the management of childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) issued by the Chinese Medical Association in 2006. 17 In the guideline, the clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of childhood CAP include fever, cough, tachypnoea (defined according to different age), difficulty breathing and/or lower chest wall indrawing. X-ray evaluation has been carried out when necessary. The study protocol was approved by the medical ethical committees of the hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the children.Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were obtained by trained personnel following standard operating procedures within 24 hour after admission. The specimens were transported immediately to the laboratory by sterile viral transport media, then divided into aliquots and immediately frozen at À80°C until further processing.Total viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 ll of NPA specimen using the AxyPrep Body Fluid DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\",\n",

If there was discordance between two tests, the sample was confirmed by monoplex PCR.Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 11.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used. For comparison of categorical data, chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used.

A weaker seasonal peak could also be distinguished in some winter months in different years ( Figure 1) .The seasonality profile of each individual virus detected was diversified. A seasonal distribution of IAV can be observed from late spring to summer (mainly March to May) and sometimes in fall (October, November or December). A wide seasonal peak of IAV infection was detected from March to August 2009 ( Figure 3A ). Although RSV was tested almost a whole year, two yearly peaks were identified.',\n",
       "  'One was found in November and/or December and the other stronger one was found in March to May of the year. The peak duration in 2009 was longer than those in other years. The seasonal trends of HRV and PIVs were similar to that of RSV, but the peaks of these three viruses fluctuated and shifted mildly ( Figure 3B ). Although IBV and ADV had a low detection rate in the study, similar seasonality was observed and their infection peaks were mainly in midwinter. Peaks in spring and summer were also observed in some years ( Figure 3C ).Our investigation did not find regular seasonality in BOV infections. A sudden increase in BOV infection was recorded in April and May 2010. Although the positive rate of HMPV infection was only 4Á8%, regular seasonality was observed from March to May of each year. Of 39 patients with WUPoyV infection, 36 were detected after July 2008.',\n",

The distribution of viral agents and infection patterns in different age groups are shown in Table 2 .Of all 971 positive children, 890 (91Á7%) were 4 years old or younger. The positive rate in this age group was significantly higher than that in children more than 4 years old (v 2 = 8Á26, P = 0Á0041). Children under 6 months were the most susceptible to respiratory viral pathogens with a positive rate of 14Á8% (Table 2) .Very few long-term prospective studies were performed for viral etiologies of ARTIs among hospitalized children.',\n",
       "  \"In this present study, the infection frequency, seasonality, co-infection pattern and clinical features of viral respiratory infections were investigated based on prospective analysis of three consecutive year's data from hospitalized children with ARTIs. Our results provided a distinctive epidemiological profile of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children with ARTIs in the study areas, which was different from those in the big cities in northern China such as Beijing and Shanghai and also different from that in adjacent Hong Kong.Overall, 48Á0% of our cases were positive for respiratory virus infections, which resembled the latest study in the same city. 21 A similar incidence rate has been obtained in neighboring regions 13, 22 and other cities such as Rome 23 and Milan, 24 but it was different from other studies. In China, the overall positive rate reported varied from 27Á3 to 74Á8% depending on different areas and detection methods.\",\n",
       "  '15, 16,        The rate of respiratory viral infections varied worldwide, and many factors such as geographic distribu-tion, study design and detection protocols could lead to these variations. 1, 7, 8, 32 In our study, leukocyte count was used as an indicator of inclusion criteria and it probably affected the positive rate. Viruses not considered in the study, for example coronaviruses, would underestimate the positive rate. Most studies showed that RSV or HRV was the most prevalent viruses in children with viral respiratory tract infection. 1 In this study, IAV was the most frequently detected respiratory virus, followed by RSV and HRV. IAV (H1N1) outbreak in 2009 could explain this shift. Data showed that about 60% of IAV infections were detected during the outbreak period. Studies showed that the H1N1 outbreak could change viral distribution patterns. 24, 29, 33 Regardless of the IAV (H1N1) outbreak, RSV and HRV were the two most common viral pathogens in ARTIs, which was consistent with most previous studies.',\n",
       "  '1, 10, 15, 16, 22,      Our study further confirmed the importance of RSV and HRV in children with ARTIs, especially in children < 4 years of age. 10, 14, 23 Our results also showed that 12Á7% of viral pathogens detected were PIV1 and PIV3, which implied that PIVs played an important role in children with ARTIs. Similar findings were obtained in the studies conducted in Shanghai, 14, 34 Changsha, 26 Harbin, 30 Hong Kong 13 and Rome. 23 The prevalence of PIV3 was twofold higher than that of PIV1, particularly in infants, which was similar with other reports, 25, 26, 30, 35 implying that infants could be more vulnerable to infection with PIV3 than PIV1.HMPV has been proven to be one of the main viral pathogens responsible for ARTIs in children. 5 The positive rate found in the study was consistent with previously published results.',\n",
       "  '10, 36, 37 In China, the infection rate of HMPV varied from 3Á2 to 10Á6%. 22, 26, 28, 29, 31 The seasonality of HMPV in this study was mainly from March to May, similar to that in Hong Kong, 36 but different from other places. 5, 37 In our study, 4Á9% of cases were positive for BOV, which coincided with 5Á0% in Hong Kong 38 and higher than Guangzhou 39 and eastern Guangdong. 22 Our result suggested that BOV might be present throughout the year with no seasonal distribution. However, seasonal distribution was noted from September to February in Hong Kong 38 and May and June in Guangzhou. 39 The use of multiple PCR made it possible to simultaneously detect a broad spectrum of viruses with excellent sensitivity, at the same time, with increased viral detection rate and co-infection rate for ARTIs.',\n",
       "  '12,40 Among our positive cases, co-infection rate was 31Á1%, which was similar to 27Á9% reported by Do et al. 10 Co-infection rate reported elsewhere varied widely from 25Á4 to 47Á9%. 40 The relatively lower co-infection rates ranging from 0Á24 to 26Á9% were reported in the studies conducted in various cities of China. 22,        In most of these studies, immunofluorescence kits were used to test a lower number of respiratory viruses. It was worth to note that in the study by Peng et al. 32 in Wuhan, China, 69Á5% of co-infection rate was reported with immunofluorescence kit. These variations might be attributed to geographic differences, diagnostic methods for viral agents and study design. 12, 32, 34, 41, 42 Pathogens in those negative patients need to be further investigated as only ten common and newly identified viruses were included in our study, which might underestimate positive rate or coinfection rate.',\n",
       "  \"It was notable that the correlation between co-infection rate and positive rate was not observed.Of multiple infections, dual infection was predominant in this study whether or not considering the IAV (H1N1) outbreak in 2009, which was consistent with previous studies. 28, 32, 42, 43 Similar with the studies conducted in the cities of Guangzhou and Wuhan, China, 28, 29 our study showed that IAV, RSV and HRV were the main viruses involved in multiple infections. High co-infection rate between these three viruses could be explained from the overlap of their seasonal distributions. A variety of predominant multiple infection patterns between respiratory viruses were observed in different studies. 12, 32, 42, 43 For example, it was shown in Martin et al. 's study 43 that ADV and coronaviruses were the most common co-infection pattern.Our study showed that RSV and HRV were the two most viruses involved in multiple infection, followed by IAV and PIVs, regardless of IAV infection in the H1N1 outbreak period.\",\n",
       "  \"It was difficult to explain the variations of coinfection patterns based only on seasonal distribution. A recent study suggested that co-infection patterns were not random and certain pathogens had higher frequency of coinfection. 41 As molecular assays only detect nucleic acid and positive result does not mean the presence of the pathogen, when studying co-infection patterns of respiratory viruses, the ability to differentiate the real causative pathogens needs to be solved first. Viral load detection could provide some clues for solving this issue. 43, 44 Although high co-infection rates have been reported in various studies, the associations among multiple infections, hospitalization rate and severity of ARTIs were still not clear with inconsistent results in different studies. 42, 43, 45 Our data suggested that multiple infection had less association with the severity of disease, consistent with Peng et al. 's study.\",\n",
       "  '32 The relationship between co-infection rates and age group was also investigated in our study, and little correlation was observed. Several previous studies observed that co-infection rates were more frequent in a certain age group, but results were varied. 32, 43 In contrast to temperate region, where most viruses had winter-spring seasonality, the respiratory viral infections in tropical and subtropical regions appeared mainly to be spring-summer seasonality. 9 In this study, due to the high detection rate and similar seasonality of RSV, HRV, IAV, PIV and HMPV, an overall spring-summer seasonality of viral respiratory infections in children was concluded. Studies conducted in Hong Kong showed that a clear seasonal peak was from April to September, 36, 46 with a longer duration than our study. The overall seasonality in this study was also different from the studies conducted in northern or central cities of China, in which the seasonality of most viruses presented in autumn-winter and/or winter-spring.',\n",
       "  '15,    30 The winter-spring seasonality was also observed in Guangzhou, a city about 150 kilometers north of Shenzhen. 28 Different seasonal onset and duration were observed in various studies conducted in (sub-) tropical regions. In these studies, ambient temperature, humidity and rainfall were widely used to explain these differences in seasonality, but inconsistent results were observed. 9, 46, 47 Although most studies demonstrated that the seasonality of viral respiratory infections was correlated with increased rainfall, effects of climate factors such as humidity and temperature on the seasonality were complex and interactive. 9, 46, 48 The study areas have four indistinct seasons, and the coldest month usually emerges in January (average 12°C). During the period from March to May, the weather featured warm ambient temperature (average 18-25°C), high relative humidity (average 85%-90%) and increasing rainfall. These meteorological conditions were perhaps conducive to viral survival.',\n",
       "  '9, 48 In addition, intensive temperature fluctuations during seasonal alternation could increase the susceptibility to infections. 49 As reported in other studies in temperate, tropical and subtropical regions, viral infection rates in children population showed an inverse correlation with age, with younger individuals experiencing higher viral infection rates. 3, 4, 6, 9, 24 Our results suggested that children younger than 4 years of age, particularly <6 months, were at higher risk of hospitalization for ARTIs, compared with older children. This was particularly substantiated in RSV infection. Our presumption was supported by other studies. 14,25-28 Of course, this speculation needed to be validated by the population-based study. The findings reported elsewhere suggested that more males than females were affected by ARTIs, which were not observed in our study.Notably, our study occurred over a span of 3 years, which included the IAV (H1N1) outbreak in 2009. The impact of the outbreak on the results should be considered.',\n",
       "  'Data showed that the detection rate of IAV increased significantly and co-infection rate during outbreak months was much higher than average co-infection rate. Unfortunately, we did not type these influenza strains based on the original study design. It was most likely that these strains contributed to the relatively high proportion of IAV. Relatively higher single and multiple infections of RSV, HRV and PIVs were also observed during the outbreak of IAV. Increased susceptible population and awareness, intensive testing and altered patient and physician behavior could lead to these increases. These factors could partly explain the relatively high proportion of pneumonia cases in the study. Furthermore, studies showed that the outbreak of IAV (H1N1) could increase the risk of other viral infections such as RSV and HRV. 24, 33 Other limitations also existed in this study. First, molecular methods allowed the detection of only viral nucleic acid even without virus replication, which complicates the interpretation of positive detection results.',\n",
       "  \" Second, the subtype identification of some common respiratory viruses such as IAV and HRV was not performed in our study, particularly during the IAV (H1N1) outbreak in 2009.In summary, despite those aforementioned limitations, this three consecutive years' surveillance would provide a basic profile of the spectrum, seasonality, age and gender distribution, co-infection patterns as well as clinical association of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children in the study sites. It could help the prediction, prevention and control of ARTIs in children.\"],\n",
       " ['There have been an increasing number of reports implicating Gammaproteobacteria as often carrying genes of drug resistance from colonized sink traps to vulnerable hospitalized patients. However, the mechanism of transmission from the wastewater of the sink P-trap to patients remains poorly understood. Herein we report the use of a designated hand-washing sink lab gallery to model dispersion of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli from sink wastewater to the surrounding environment. We found no dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli directly from the P-trap to the sink basin or surrounding countertop with coincident water flow from a faucet. However, when the GFP-expressing E. coli cells were allowed to mature in the P-trap under conditions similar to those in a hospital environment, a GFP-expressing E. coli-containing putative biofilm extended upward over 7 days to reach the strainer. This subsequently resulted in droplet dispersion to the surrounding areas (<30 in.) during faucet operation.',\n",
       "  'We also demonstrated that P-trap colonization could occur by retrograde transmission along a common pipe. We postulate that the organisms mobilize up to the strainer from the P-trap, resulting in droplet dispersion rather than dispersion directly from the P-trap. This work helps to further define the mode of transmission of bacteria from a P-trap reservoir to a vulnerable hospitalized patient. IMPORTANCE Many recent reports demonstrate that sink drain pipes become colonized with highly consequential multidrug-resistant bacteria, which then results in hospital-acquired infections. However, the mechanism of dispersal of bacteria from the sink to patients has not been fully elucidated. Through establishment of a unique sink gallery, this work found that a staged mode of transmission involving biofilm growth from the lower pipe to the sink strainer and subsequent splatter to the bowl and surrounding area occurs rather than splatter directly from the water in the lower pipe.',\n",
       "  'We have also demonstrated that bacterial transmission can occur via connections in wastewater plumbing to neighboring sinks. This work helps to more clearly define the mechanism and risk of transmission from a wastewater source to hospitalized patients in a world with increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can thrive in wastewater environments and cause infections in vulnerable patients.Text: D espite early reports (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , the premise that hand-wash sink traps can act as reservoirs of bacteria that cause nosocomial infections has been frequently overlooked. There has recently been an alarming increase in sink-related outbreaks worldwide, with many reports establishing an observational link (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . A sink often operates as an open conduit to wastewater in a patient care area that is often in the same room as the patient.Health care establishments often invest in desperate interventions to deal with nosocomial outbreaks.',\n",
       "  \"The preferred method for addressing most of the environmentrelated transmission is to employ enhanced cleaning using chemical and physical agents (14, 15) . Unfortunately, routine approaches are inefficient in completely eliminating drug-resistant Gammaproteobacteria in an inaccessible microbiologically active area such as a sink trap (6, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . The wet, humid, and relatively protected environment in a sink trap favors the formation of rich stable microbial communities (16, 21, 22) . These communities will be exposed to liquids and waste that are discarded in a sink and may include antimicrobials, discarded beverages, soap, presumably pathogenic bacteria from health care workers' hands, and other items. In short, sink traps could serve as a breeding ground for opportunistic and highly antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that cannot be easily cleaned or removed (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) .There are many reports of a genetic association between pathogens found in sink traps and those found in patients (29, 30) .\",\n",
       "  'However, surprisingly little work has been done to understand the microscale transmission dynamics. It was previously demonstrated using a suspension of fluorescent particles (Glo Germ; Glo Germ Co., Moab, UT) that material injected into the P-trap gets dispersed around a hand-washing sink (6) . This result however has not been replicated hitherto in the follow-up studies. Dispersion has never been investigated with living organisms. Ultimately, many details remain unaddressed surrounding the spread of Enterobacteriaceae in sink-trap wastewater systems: (i) can organisms grow retrograde from the P-trap water to the sink strainer, (ii) can organisms spread from one sink to another along the internal surfaces of pipes with shared drainage systems, and (iii) which portion of a colonized drain pipe results in dispersion into the sink bowl during a hand-washing event? We aim to better understand the dispersion dynamics of Gammaproteobacteria living in the wastewater of a sink strainer and P-trap into an area where patients and health care workers could be exposed.',\n",

In the first 14 days following the installation of the P-trap with established green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli and just water running from the faucet, GFPexpressing E. coli was not detected in the tailpipe beyond 1.5 in. above the liquid level in the P-trap. GFP-expressing E. coli, however, was found to be viable in the P-trap without any nutrients added. A nutrient regimen was then instituted to understand the influence of nutrients on mobility and upward growth.

GFP-expressing E. coli was not detected in the faucet water.Sink-to-sink transmission of bacteria. In these experiments, a flanking sink (sink 5) was the only P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli and therefore was the sole source for transmission to the connected sinks.

Faucet water and aerators tested negative for GFP-expressing E. coli. Irrespective of the starting inoculum concentration, on day 7 the highest level of colonization was recorded in the sink 3 P-trap. After day 7, when the nutrient regimen (described previously) was followed for an additional 7 days in each of the sinks in the sink gallery with an inoculum concentration of Ͼ10 10 CFU/ml, GFP-expressing E. coli was detected in the strainers of sinks 2 and 3 on day 14.

Similarly, no fluorescent CFU were detected when GFPexpressing E. coli was inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer. Interestingly, when there was conspicuous water backup over the strainer as a result of a higher water flow rate from the faucet than the drainage rate from the P-trap, dispersal was detected on the plates attached to the bowl surface.The dispersion pattern recorded when the sink bowl was coated with GFPexpressing E. coli was comparable to the pattern recorded when the sink bowl was coated with fluorescent microspheres (Fig.',\n",
       "  '2) . Dispersion was significantly higher along the axes (zones 6, 9, 11, and 12) and lower at the corners of the sink counter space (zones 4, 7, and 10).In contrast, dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli caused by the faucet operation was much more extensive when the strainer was allowed to be colonized with GFPexpressing E. coli prior to the dispersion experiment. In addition to the sink counter space, we measured dispersion to the sink bowl, faucet, faucet handles, splatter shields, and the extended counter surface. Dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli was highest on the plates attached to the sink bowl (Fig. 3b) . Further, dispersion was greater along the Ϫ\" and \"ϩ\" denote the absence and presence of GFP-expressing E. coli, respectively.minor axis of the sink bowl (Fig. 3b , zones B3, B4, and B10) than along the major axis of the sink bowl, associated with a shorter distance from the strike point of the faucet water to the bowl along this axis.',\n",
       "  'The next highest CFU count from the dispersal was recorded on the counter area near the faucets (Fig. 3a , zones 12 and 11). A similar pattern of higher dispersion near the faucets and lower dispersion at the corners of the counter space (Fig. 3a , zones 4, 7, and 10) was also observed using microspheres. Dispersion was also recorded in other zones of the counter space, on the Plexiglas splatter shields, faucets, faucet handles, and extended surface (Fig. 3c ). There were no GFP-expressing E. coli CFU recorded on plates placed beyond 30 in. from the strainer, demarcating the range of dispersion under these experimental conditions. Table 2 gives a summary of the total distribution loads recorded using fluorescent microspheres and GFP-expressing E. coli across each experiment. The loads of dispersion on the sink counter were comparable when the sink bowl was coated with microspheres or GFP-expressing E. coli before the faucet operation.',\n",
       "  'Although the dispersion load on the sink counter was lower when the sink strainer was colonized, it is interesting to note that the sink bowl received the highest dispersion.To mimic dispersion in a hospital setting, we first investigated whether GFPexpressing E. coli would establish consistent colonization in a sink trap as many other Gammaproteobacteria implicated in nosocomial outbreaks have done (6, 28) . Many recent reports demonstrate that P-traps become colonized with highly consequential Gammaproteobacteria, which then results in nosocomial transmission (29, 31, 32) . The retained water in a sink P-trap is present to provide a water barrier to prevent off-gassing of sewer smell, but it may inadvertently provide favorable conditions for pathogenic and opportunistic antibiotic-resistant microorganisms to survive and develop resilient biofilms (3, 33) . However, the mechanism of dispersal of the bacteria in the P-trap to patients or the surrounding health care area had not been fully elucidated.',\n",
       "  'We began with the hypothesis that the bacteria originate from the P-trap via droplet creation when the water from the faucet hits the P-trap water, thus contaminating the sink bowl and the surrounding area. The finding supporting this theory had been previously reported using Glo Germ particles (6) . However, in the present study with careful attention to avoid strainer and tail piece contamination, the dispersal directly from the sink P-trap with either microspheres or GFP-expressing E. coli could not be reproduced as previously reported (6) .Rather this work demonstrates a different, more staged mode of transmission from a P-trap reservoir to the sink and surrounding environment. GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap alone was sustained for 14 days but did not grow or mobilize up the tailpipe to the strainer with just intermittent water exposure. However, when nutrients were subsequently added to the system, the organisms rapidly grew up the tailpipe to the strainer at approximately an inch per day.',\n",
       "  \"In a real-world setting, motility of bacteria inside the tailpipe is restricted to relatively sporadic and brief wetting events in which swimming is an opportunity to colonize new surfaces. It is assumed that once established, the biofilm promotes the upward growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the tailpipe at an accelerated rate. The nutrient regimen that promoted colonization in our model reflects our and others' observations of items commonly disposed of in hospital sinks (intravenous fluids, feeding supplements, and leftover beverages) (5, 32) .Transmission of bacteria between sinks via a common pipe was a key finding in this study as this highlights the concept that premise plumbing may be a more continuous system with shared microbiology than a single isolated sink. The sink gallery used in this study provided a unique in situ advantage to investigate sink-to-sink transmission of bacteria through common drains.\",\n",
       "  'The two possible mechanisms for P-trap strainers becoming colonized are seeding of organisms from above and retrograde spread of organisms along common pipes in a hospital wastewater infrastructure. Here we demonstrate that it is possible for GFP-expressing E. coli to contaminate adjacent P-traps with just time and water given a standard U.S. code piping rise of 0.25 ft/ft. Sink-to-sink or retrograde transmission may explain the recurrence of pathogen colonization following intervention strategies like disinfection or replacement of plumbing (23) . Sink 3 was lowest on the slope in the drain line (see Fig. 4 ) with arguably the most opportunity for reflux and retrograde wetting. Sink 1, on the other hand, was farthest away from the source (sink 5), and its P-trap had the greatest incline in the drain line connecting the sinks, which could perhaps contribute to the reasons there was no GFP-expressing E. coli colonization detected in it after 7 days.',\n",
       "  'There has been more investigation about microbiologic dynamics of infectious viral particles such as those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola viruses through premise plumbing systems (34) (35) (36) . However, the microbiology, sustainability, and dynamics might be very different, although the backflow and inoculation issues could have some parallels when comparing viruses to bacteria. As Enterobacteriaceae can either multiply or remain viable for long periods of time in biofilms coating the interior of P-traps and the connected plumbing, it may not be sustainable to target any intervention limited to a single isolated sink as a source of a particular pathogen.Data from different dispersal experiments suggest that although P-traps can act as the source or the reservoir of pathogens, the physical presence of the organism in the sink bowl or colonization of the strainer is necessary for the dispersal to occur.',\n",
       "  'Colonization of strainers or drains reported in earlier studies (7, 10, 13, 24, 37) was perhaps a result of ascending biofilm growth from the P-trap to the strainer or introduction through contaminated fluids. Many of the studies used swab samples, which likely sampled the strainer rather than P-trap water (17, 20) . Once the strainer was colonized, the water from the faucet resulted in GFP-expressing E. coli dispersion in the bowl and to the surrounding surfaces of up to 30 in. The range of dispersal (6) . Greater dispersal near the faucet may be attributed to the specific designs of the sink bowl and faucet in this study, which determine the contact angle of water impact. This is an important finding since many sinks in hospitals are similar in design, with faucet handles representing a high-touch surface for the sink users (38) .',\n",
       "  'It can also be concluded from the dispersion experiments that secondary and successive dispersals would likely increase the degree and the scope of dispersion. There are several limitations to this work. First the use of similar sink bowls across these sinks only examines the dispersion pattern of this particular sink design. Similarly the sink-to-sink transmission may not be applicable to all wastewater plumbing systems as the fixtures on the pipe are very close together, unlike most layouts in health care settings. However, we speculate that transmission could occur on larger systems over greater time scales, especially if heavy nutrient and contamination loads were also included. GFP-expressing E. coli is a laboratory surrogate, and the putative biofilms established in the short time frame of our experiments are unlikely to be as complex or stable as biofilms developed in a hospital wastewater system over many years.',\n",
       "  'However, to address the monomicrobial dominance of the GFP-expressing E. coli added to the system, we kept the system open, and other environmental organisms were able to cocolonize in an attempt to mimic the hospital system. Another limitation was the need to add nutrients to the drain to ensure rapid and robust colonization. We are not clear how widespread the practice of disposing of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids or leftover beverages in the hand-wash sinks is; however, we have observed this practice, and anecdotally it appears to be relatively common in the United States. We also did not completely characterize the droplet sizes, nor do we demonstrate air sampling to understand if the dispersion is only droplet or if there are also aerosols that contain GFP-expressing E. coli. This would require additional testing and is planned as future work.In summary, this work for the first time better models the mechanisms of spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens arising from the sink drain and infecting patients.',\n",
       "  'Droplet dispersion from the P-trap does not happen directly. Rather it is a multistage process: dispersal originates from the strainer and/or the bowl after growth of the biofilm up from the microbial reservoir of the P-trap. We also demonstrate sink-to-sink transmission via a common sanitary pipe. This work could have implications for patient safety, infection control, and interventions as well as the design of future hospital plumbing systems to eliminate this mode of transmission to vulnerable hospitalized patients.Sink gallery design. A dedicated sink gallery was set up to simulate hospital hand-washing sinks. The gallery was comprised of five sink modules assembled next to each other (Fig. 4) . The five hand-wash sink stations were identical in bowl designs and dimensions and were modeled from the most common intensive care unit hand-washing sink type in the acute care hospital at the University of Virginia Medical Center.',\n",
       "  'Partitions made of 24-in.-high Plexiglas sheet were installed between the sinks to prevent splatter and cross contamination. Each sink module was built with Corian integrated sink/countertops without an overflow and fitted with an 8-in. centerset 2-handle gooseneck faucet (Elkay, Oak Brook, IL). The drain line (Dearborn Brass-Oatey, Cleveland, OH). All of the fixtures were made of brass with chrome plating. Each of the sink P-traps was connected to a 3-in. common cast-iron pipe sloping into a T-joint leading into the building sanitary line located behind sink 3 (Fig. 4) .Inoculation, growth, and establishment of GFP-expressing E. coli in sink P-traps. For the GFP-expressing E. coli strain (ATCC 25922GFP), the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is contained on a plasmid that also contains an ampicillin resistance gene. A single isolated colony of GFP-expressing E. coli grown from a Ϫ80°C stock was inoculated into 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (ATCC medium 2855).',\n",
       "  'The inoculum concentration and method varied for each experiment. For establishment of GFP-expressing E. coli in sink P-traps, new autoclaved P-traps were filled with 100 ml 0.1ϫ TSB and inoculated with ϳ10 3 CFU/ml GFPexpressing E. coli. Following inoculation, both ends of the P-traps were covered with perforated Parafilm (Bemis, Inc., Oshkosh, WI) and allowed to incubate at room temperature (22 Ϯ 2°C) for 14 days to facilitate adherent bacterial growth. The medium in the P-trap was decanted and replaced with fresh 0.1ϫ TSB every 48 h. An aliquot of decanted medium and a swab sample from the inner surface of the P-trap were plated on tryptic soy agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (TSA) to monitor the growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-traps. TSA plates were incubated overnight at 37°C, and CFU fluorescing under UV light were enumerated.',\n",
       "  'All preparatory culturing of GFP-expressing E. coli took place in a separate room from the sink gallery to avoid unintentional contamination.Installation of P-traps colonized with GFP-expressing E.coli. After the 14-day incubation, P-traps were fastened into the plumbing of the sinks (Fig. 5a) . The remainder of the drain line was either autoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, and trap arms) prior to installation or surface disinfected (sink bowl, countertop, and faucets) with Caviwipes-1 (Meterx Research, Romulus, MI), maintaining at least 1 min of contact time. After the P-trap was installed, a daily regimen was followed in which 25 ml of TSB followed by 25 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution (saline) were added in the ratio 1:3 via the strainer (Fig. 5b) to mimic the potential nutrient exposure in the hospital.Sampling and enumeration of GFP-expressing E. coli.',\n",
       "  'To monitor the growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the plumbing, sampling ports were drilled along the length of the tailpiece (between the P-trap and the strainer) and the trap arm (between the P-trap and the common line). These holes were fitted with size 00 silicone stoppers (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) (Fig. 5a) . Sterile cotton swabs (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) presoaked in saline were inserted through these sampling ports, and samples were collected by turning the swab in a circular motion on the inner surface (ϳ20 cm 2 ) of the tailpipes. Sample swabs were pulse-vortexed in 3 ml saline, and serial dilutions were plated on TSA. The strainer, faucet aerator, and bowl surface were sampled with presoaked swabs and processed as described earlier.Sink-to-sink transmission of bacteria.

Identification to the species level of fluorescent and nonfluorescent colonies identified from mixed pipe cultures was performed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Vitek-MS; bioMérieux, Durham, NC). The wastewater paths of sinks 1 to 4 were either autoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, P-traps, and trap arms) prior to installation or surface disinfected (sink bowl, countertop, and faucets) with Caviwipes-1 (Meterx Research, Romulus, MI). Faucets on each of the five sinks were turned on simultaneously for 1 min, supplying water at a flow rate of 8 liters/min, once every 24 h for 7 days.

Rapid PCR tests were expected to facilitate timely and appropriate initiation of treatment, improve outbreak prevention and infection control measures, and expedite the assessment of patients in EDs.In this study, we analysed routinely collected data to determine whether rapid PCR testing for influenza and RSV infections in EDs is associated with improved patient and laboratory outcomes.',\n",

An analysis of outcomes for more than 300 adults at a tertiary care centre in New York found that early diagnosis of respiratory infections was associated with significantly fewer hospitalisations of influenza-positive patients. 7 In a small Irish study (73 patients), the hospital admission rate for obstetric patients declined from 88% to 45% after on-site rapid influenza PCR testing was introduced.',\n",

This finding was not unexpected, as test turnaround time is not the only rate-limiting factor for decision making in EDs. 16 Before rapid PCR methods were introduced, the long turnaround time of multiplex PCR did not necessarily extend a patient's stay in the ED, as they were usually admitted to hospital or discharged home before the results were available.\",\n",

       "  'The effect of PCR-based rapid testing on the ordering of other laboratory tests has not previously been reported, although some studies of antigen-based pointof-care testing have examined this outcome. 12 Consistent with our finding, several investigators have reported fewer blood culture tests 19, 20 and basic biochemistry and haematology tests, including full blood count, 20,21 C-reactive protein testing, 21 and urinalysis, 20,21 when point-of-care testing was used.The higher rate of positive results for patients tested by rapid PCR than for those tested by standard PCR may reflect a higher prevalence of influenza during 2017 than in 2016.The rapid PCR system in our study accurately detects influenza viruses A/B and RSV but, unlike the standard multiplex PCR, cannot detect other clinically relevant respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus. If infection with other respiratory viruses is suspected, patients may therefore need further investigations.',\n",
       "  'Standard multiplex PCR can provide broader information, as it can detect multiple respiratory viruses in a single run, although the long turnaround time restricts its suitability for urgent clinical decision making. Improving the turnaround time of multiplex PCR analysis may achieve better outcomes.The strengths of our study include its relatively large sample size; further, unlike many similar investigations, ours was a multicentre study in four hospital EDs, enhancing the generalisability of our findings. However, our analyses were not adjusted for comorbid conditions, as this information was not available. Because our study was an uncontrolled before-and-after study, our results cannot be interpreted as indicating causal relationships. As with all non-randomised trials, we could not fully account for all potential confounding variables, nor for temporal trends and other unmeasured factors, such as changes in clinician testing practices or differences in the prevalence and severity of disease during the two study periods.',\n",
       "  '22 For example, a shortage of inpatient beds caused by a high prevalence of influenza could influence decisions in a busy ED about admitting patients to hospital. However, we attempted to reduce seasonal effects by selecting similar time frames for the two study periods, to reduce selection bias by including all ED patients tested for influenza virus and RSV, and to control for differences in baseline patient characteristics by applying multivariate modelling. As medications data were not available to us, we were unable to assess the impact of rapid PCR testing on antibiotic and antiviral drug use. Similarly, the cost-benefit balance of rapid testing was not evaluated because relevant data were not available. The cost per patient of rapid PCR testing is generally higher than for central laboratory testing, but our findings suggest potential savings through lower numbers of hospital admissions and reduced resource use.',\n",
       "  'This question could be evaluated in a further study.Rapid PCR testing for influenza virus and RSV infections in patients attending EDs was associated with significant improvements in a range of patient and laboratory outcomes, suggesting potential benefits for both the patients and the health care system. A cost-benefit analysis could examine the impact of rapid PCR testing on bed management and antimicrobial drug prescribing.'],\n",
       " ['Antibodies against foreign antigens are a critical component of the overall immune response and can facilitate pathogen clearance during a primary infection and also protect against subsequent infections. Dysregulation of the antibody response can lead to an autoimmune disease, malignancy, or enhanced infection. Since the experimental delineation of a distinct B cell lineage in 1965, various methods have been developed to understand antigen-specific B cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, infection, and vaccination. In this review, we summarize the established techniques and discuss new and emerging technologies for probing the B cell response in vitro and in vivo by taking advantage of the specificity of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated and secreted antibodies. These include ELISPOT, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy to identify and/or isolate primary antigen-specific B cells. We also present our approach to identify rare antigen-specific B cells using magnetic enrichment followed by flow cytometry.',\n",
       "  'Once these cells are isolated, in vitro proliferation assays and adoptive transfer experiments in mice can be used to further characterize antigen-specific B cell activation, function, and fate. Transgenic mouse models of B cells targeting model antigens and of B cell signaling have also significantly advanced our understanding of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.Text: In his Nobel lecture in 1908, Paul Ehrlich likened the antibody-antigen interaction to a lock and key. He reasoned that antitoxins (antibodies) contained in a solution in the serum of immunized animals must be identical to a cellular receptor \"for a really well-made key will not open different locks at the same time\" (1) . It took almost five decades before immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the cellular origin of antibodies (2) . Major strides in the B cell and antibody field followed in the 1970s with the development of hybridoma technology to produce monoclonal antibodies and the discovery that somatic rearrangement during B cell differentiation was responsible for antibody diversification (3, 4) .',\n",
       "  'The subsequent explosion of available monoclonal antibodies led to revolutionary diagnostic, therapeutic, and research reagents to distinguish different types of immune cells (5) . Together, these discoveries have allowed us to probe humoral immunity at the level of the antigen-specific B cell.Methods to probe the antigen-specific B cell response have advanced our understanding of how to harness the remarkable breadth of the B cell repertoire and the exquisite specificity of the individual B cell in developing (1) vaccine candidates that elicit protective antibodies; (2) antibodies that prevent disease when given prophylactically; and (3) antibodies that can be given as therapy after the onset of disease. Many of the vaccines currently available were originally developed empirically either by inactivating, attenuating, or administering a subunit of the pathogen.',\n",
       "  \"However, vaccine development against pathogens that are traditionally difficult to vaccinate against may rely on a deeper investigation of the B cell response to the antigens exposed on the surface of these pathogens.For HIV-1, the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that protect against infection across diverse viral isolates has intensified efforts to understand the developmental pathway of the rare B cells that produce these antibodies (6) (7) (8) (9) . Insights into the ontogeny of these rare B cells could allow the design of a step-wise vaccine regimen that stimulates the germ-line precursor to expand and mature to produce circulating bnAbs which could protect against HIV acquisition (10, 11) . For RSV, stabilized versions of the fusion (F) protein in the pre-fusion conformation have led to insights in the B cell's response to infection and has generated potentially safer and more efficacious vaccine candidates (12, 13) .\",\n",
       "  'Influenza also performs fusion through the stem region of the hemagglutinin protein, and the identification of B cells that target this relatively conserved site has spurred research on the development of a universal influenza vaccine (14) (15) (16) . Like RSV, HIV, and influenza, the fusion proteins of EBV and CMV exist in a pre-fusion conformation, and stabilization in their pre-fusion states could greatly accelerate vaccine development against these pathogens (17-19). Rare memory B cells producing antibodies specific for the EBV fusion machinery have been isolated; these can neutralize both B cell and epithelial cell infection (20). A new paradigm in malaria vaccine development is also emerging with the discovery of IgM+ and IgD+ memory B cells targeting the Merozoite Surface Protein 1, that rapidly respond to malaria re-infection (21). Further, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting a novel and conserved site on the Circumsporozoite Protein have been isolated from B cells (22).',\n",
       "  'Together, these examples demonstrate the importance of studying antigen-specific humoral responses to infectious diseases. The solutions to the crystal structures of surface proteins for a variety of pathogens, the conformational stabilization of these antigens, and the application of the methods summarized in this review, to probe antigen-specific B cell responses, have created new opportunities for systematic and rational vaccine design for HIV, RSV, EBV, malaria, and many other pathogens.The study of B cell responses has not only informed vaccine design but has also advanced our understanding of antibodymediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (23, 24). Up to 20% of mature, naïve B cells have receptors with the capacity to bind self-antigens (25). Although these cells are potentially pathogenic, the deletion of B cells with high affinity to self-antigen through apoptosis, anergy of B cells with low affinity to self-antigen, and the absence of T cell help combine together to protect against autoimmune disease in mice (26).',\n",
       "  'The study of autoantigen-specific B cells and a detailed analysis of B cell subsets with pathogenic potential in humans could lead to a better understanding of how to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases.Although the term antigen-specific B cell is used throughout this mini-review to denote the analysis of B cells based on binding between the B cell receptor (BCR) and a specific antigen used as bait, it is important to keep in mind that BCRs within the polyclonal B cell repertoire exhibit a spectrum of polyreactivity. On one end of the spectrum, a highly polyreactive BCR is able to bind multiple structurally unrelated antigens with physiologically relevant affinities. The frequency of polyreactivity in the normal adult human B cell repertoire has been estimated to be 4% of naïve B cells, 23% of IgG+ memory B cells, and 26% of intestinal IgA+ and IgG+ plasmablasts (27-29).',\n",
       "  'On the other end of the spectrum, a mono reactive BCR is activated only when it encounters a single cognate antigen. Although there are exceptions, the accumulation of somatic hypermutations within the variable regions of the BCR during the process of affinity maturation is generally thought to lead to increased affinity and specificity for the cognate antigen (30, 31).Several general techniques are commonly used to identify antigen-specific B cells ( Table 1 ). The B cell enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) technique relies on the principle of capturing the secreted antibody in the vicinity of each cell. In the B cell ELISPOT, antibody secreting B cells (ASCs) present in a sample or differentiated in vitro are added to plates coated with the antigen of interest. Antigen-specific antibodies will bind in close proximity to the location of the individual B cells producing those antibodies.',\n",
       "  'Enzyme or fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies are then used to visualize spots of antibody secretion and binding to plate-bound antigen at the location of the ASCs. Each spot corresponds to antibody produced from a single antigen-specific B cell and therefore the technique is extremely sensitive. Secondary antibodies conjugated to combinatorial colored beads can also be used to detect the antibodies secreted from individual B cells with the advantage of multiplexing the assay (32). One limitation of the assay is its requirement for antibody secretion by B cells thereby limiting the assay to only a subset of B cells in the repertoire, namely ASCs (33). Memory B cells can be stimulated in vitro to differentiate into ASCs prior to addition to the antigen-coated plate (34) . Further, the antigenspecific B cells identified by ELISPOT are generally not available for downstream analysis.Limiting dilution is another technique that has been used to isolate antigen-specific B cells.',\n",
       "  'In this approach, primary cells can be diluted serially until individual B cells are separated in microwell plates (36) . The B cells can then be cultured and expanded ex vivo and/or immortalized using EBV such that each well contains a monoclonal antibody (3, 37, 38) . Antigen-specific B cells can be selected by screening the culture supernatants for monoclonal antibodies that bind an antigen of interest. Although antibodies can be sequenced and cloned, the requirement for an ex vivo culture prior to selection precludes determination of the transcriptional profile of the original B cell in this approach. This technique can potentially be time-consuming and laborious, but the use of microfluidics and robotics has greatly improved the throughput for selecting antigen-specific B cells (39) . Advances in single cell next generation sequencing technology have allowed high throughput transcriptional profiling and sequencing of paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (40) .',\n",
       "  'In this approach, antigen specificity can be tested after monoclonal antibodies are cloned and produced using the sequencing data. This method can be useful in identifying antigen-specific B cells that have undergone clonal expansion after vaccination or acute infection (41) . Flow cytometry is the most common method used for single cell analysis and isolation (39) . Flow cytometry-based analysis of antigen-specific B cells is dependent on labeling antigen with a fluorescent tag to allow detection. Fluorochromes can either be attached covalently via chemical conjugation to the antigen, expressed as a recombinant fusion protein, or attached non-covalently by biotinylating the antigen. After biotinylation, fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin is added to generate a labeled tetramer of the antigen. Biotinylation of the antigen at a ratio ≤1 biotin to 1 antigen is important, since each streptavidin has the potential to bind four biotins.',\n",
       "  'If the ratio of biotin to antigen is >1:1, then clumping and precipitation of the antigen out of solution can occur as soon as streptavidin is added. Alternatively, site directed biotinylation can be accomplished by adding either an AviTag or BioEase tag to the recombinant antigen prior to expression (77, 78) . When site-specific biotinylation is utilized, researchers must keep in mind that the tag may occlude an epitope from recognition by B cells which can be problematic for vaccine antigens. Further, for proteins that oligomerize, multiple tags may be incorporated, possibly resulting in aggregation.Another important consideration is the potential for confounding by B cells in the repertoire that bind to the fluorochrome, streptavidin, or any linkers rather than to the antigen of interest. Binding between fluorochromes, linkers, or streptavidin and BCRs from humans and mice never exposed to these antigens are generally of low affinity, and these BCRs are generally expressed by naïve and potentially polyreactive B cells (62, 79, 80) .',\n",
       "  'Dual labeling, in which the same antigen is separately labeled with two different fluorochromes, can be used to identify double positive B cells and remove confounding by B cells that bind the fluorochrome (12, 42) . However, even when tetramers are utilized for dual labeling, streptavidin-specific B cells will contaminate the double positive population. To fully remove confounding from the fluorochrome, streptavidin, and linkers, a \"decoy\" tetramer can be used to identify these contaminating B cells (21, 26). In this approach, the same fluorochrome used to identify antigen-specific B cells is conjugated to a different fluorochrome such that the emission spectrum is altered by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (26). Decoy-binding B cells can therefore be excluded from the true antigen-specific B cells.',\n",
       "  'Notably, it is critical to use the same source of fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin in the tetramer and decoy reagent, because conjugation methods, recombinant streptavidin, and protein fluorochromes like R-phycoerythrin vary enough from company to company to alter some of the epitopes available for B cells to bind.One weakness of the flow cytometric approach is the reliance on antigens that can be readily conjugated to a fluorochrome or biotinylated. In addition to recombinant proteins and synthesized peptides, labeled polysaccharides, lipids, haptens, virus-like particles, and pseudo viruses have also been used to identify antigen-specific cells by flow cytometry (33,                  . Further, epitope-specific B cells have been identified by screening bacteriophage-displays or microarray peptide libraries with polyclonal antibodies targeting the native antigen to select conformational epitopes that can be fused to fluorescent proteins for use in flow cytometry (47, 60) .With technologic advancements increasing the number of simultaneously measurable parameters, antigen-specific B cells can be further characterized by cell surface markers and intracellular staining.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the immunoglobulin capture assay is a flow cytometry-based adaptation of the ELISPOT assay in which a streptavidin-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody carrying four biotinylated anti-IgG antibodies is used to simultaneously bind plasmablasts and capture secreted antibody followed by fluorescent-labeled antigen to detect antigenspecific plasmablasts (61) . The mean fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the level of BCR expression also provides a measure of the relative amount of antigen binding to a B cell and can be used as a rough surrogate for binding affinity (79, 81, 82) . Preincubation of B cells with increasing concentrations of a monomeric antigen prior to labeling with tetrameric antigen can also be used to further quantify binding affinity. Cells expressing high affinity BCRs will bind monomeric antigen at low concentrations, whereas low affinity BCRs will require higher concentrations of monomeric antigen to compete with and inhibit tetramer binding (26).',\n",
       "  'Individual cells can also be isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for downstream analysis, including BCR sequencing and cloning, BCR affinity measurement, in vitro proliferation, and transcriptional profiling. Methods have recently been developed to further improve the sensitivity for detecting rare antigen-specific B cells. Magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting the fluorochrome on the antigen of interest, allow for the enrichment of antigen-specific B cells prior to flow cytometry (20, 26, 80, 83) . This approach is particularly useful for detecting rare antigenspecific naïve B cells, autoreactive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts (21, 26, 47, 50) . The magnetic enrichment strategy allows for the analysis of significantly more cells in a shorter period of time by concentrating the cells of interest prior to flow cytometry (Figure 1) .',\n",
       "  'Notably, as with any method that seeks to identify a population of cells at a very low frequency, the background and noise inherent in the detection system is magnified with respect to the signal of interest, especially when that signal is weak. Therefore, to detect the antigen-specific population of interest, the following considerations are critical: (1) Using decoys to exclude B cells of unwanted specificities;(2) careful design of flow cytometry panels to avoid emission spillover into the channel for the antigen of interest; and (3) choosing the brightest fluorochromes, like R-phycoerythrin or allophycocyanin.In vivo methods to probe antigen-specific B cell responses in the presence of other antigen-presenting cells and T cell helpers, have increased our mechanistic understanding of the humoral immune response during vaccination, infection, and autoimmunity. Adoptively transferred B cells can be distinguished from recipient lymphocytes by taking advantage of mouse strains with allelic variations in CD45 or mice devoid of B cells.',\n",
       "  'The adoptively transferred B cells can come from wildtype mice or from mice expressing transgenic BCRs ( Table 2) , and antigen-specific B cells can be analyzed using the techniques described above.Microscopy is another general technique that has been used to identify antigen-specific cells in vivo and offers the advantage of direct visualization. In the first reported application of this technique to demonstrate the cellular origin of antibodies in 1955, fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against ovalbumin and human immunoglobulin were used to stain tissue sections of the spleen from hyperimmune rabbits (2) . Since then, other groups have fluorescently labeled antigens to localize antigen-specific B cells by microscopy (62, 65) . Advances in laser capture dissection microscopy, already used in the T cell field, also provide an opportunity for isolating individual antigen-specific B cells for downstream analysis, including sequencing and cloning of the BCR or transcriptional profiling (66) .',\n",
       "  'However, antigen staining of BCRs in situ can be challenging depending on the binding of antigens from pathogens to other cellular receptors or an alteration of BCR specificity during tissue fixation or processing. Two-photon or multiphoton microscopy has the ability to resolve images at greater depths and with less photobleaching than confocal microscopy (67, 68) . As a result, this technology has allowed real-time imaging in living, intact lymphoid tissues of mice, permitting the direct in vivo observation of immune cell interactions. The dynamic movements and interactions of antigen-specific B cells can be studied in vivo by combining an adoptive transfer of individual B cells (isolated by limiting dilution or FACS) with two-photon microscopy (63, 69, 70) .Humanized mouse models are powerful tools for translating experiments in mice to applications in humans. Transgenic mice that produce humanized cytokines by knock-in replacement can be used to support human hematopoietic stem cells (104) .',\n",
       "  'Transgenic mice with complete humanization of the mouse immunoglobulin loci provide an opportunity for recapitulating the breadth of the human B cell repertoire and serve as a valuable tool for therapeutic antibody discovery (71) . However, one caveat is that the allele frequencies found in the B cell repertoires of these mouse models may not necessarily recapitulate those found in humans (72) . Mass cytometry has the potential to provide further high-dimensional analysis of antigen-specific B cells. In this method, heavy metal ion tags rather than fluorochromes are used to label cells. Since data is collected as time-offlight mass spectrometry, up to 42 unique parameters can be simultaneously measured from a single sample without significant spillover between channels or the need for compensation. Mass cytometry with heavy metal-labeled tetramers can be constructed using streptavidin (73) .',\n",
       "  'Mass cytometry with metal-labeled peptide-MHC tetramers has been used successfully to identify and characterize antigen-specific T cells, but to our knowledge has not yet been applied to antigen-specific B cells (73, 74) . One limitation of this approach is that cells are unavailable for downstream analysis since they are vaporized by a plasma torch to atomize the ion tags. However, by simultaneously detecting many more surface markers and intracellular cytokines, transcription factors, and detecting more signaling molecules from individual cells than previously possible with traditional fluorescent labels, the application of mass cytometry with dimensionality reduction algorithms could help dissect the complexity of the B cell compartment, provide a higher resolution view of B cell development, and reveal novel subsets of antigen-specific B cells involved in mediating autoimmune diseases or protection against infection.On the horizon, single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have the potential to revolutionize the study of antigen-specific immune cells (75, 76) .',\n",
       "  'The ability to generate a library of tetramers with unique barcodes could allow the simultaneous examination of gene expression profiles from a large number of cells with different antigen specificities in a single experiment. Combining barcoded tetramers with oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies and RNA-seq to simultaneously measure the protein and gene expression of antigen-specific cells could further increase the amount of unbiased multi-omic information about individual antigen-specific cells in normal and disease states and aid the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics (105) (106) (107) .The ongoing analysis of antigen-specific B cell responses has led to the development of new diagnostic, therapeutic, and research reagents. Methods for studying antigen-specific B cell responses are being increasingly applied to tackle diseases like HIV, RSV, and autoimmune diseases, in which the immune response either fails to protect or clear disease, or where it enhances disease or is responsible for the disease itself.'],\n",
       " ['Introduction. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results.',\n",

The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.Text: A respiratory viral disease caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012, in a 60-year-old man who died in Jeddah, KSA due to severe acute pneumonia and multiple organ failure  .',\n",

Such actions include washing hands with water and soap for around 20 seconds or using hand sanitizers with alcohol if no water is available. One must cover their nose and mouth during instances of sneezing and coughing with a tissue and avoid touching the mouth, nose, or eyes with their hands until washed properly. Repeatedly touched surfaces, such as door knobs, should be disinfected and cleaned regularly. Intimate personal contact, e.g., kissing, and sharing cups or eating utensils must also be avoided  .Many studies have been conducted in recent years in Saudi Arabia to combat this deadly disease. A large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV just on the basis of clinical presentation  .',\n",

Identification of a confirmed case is necessary to implement preventive strategies to combat the spread of the disease to family members and hospital healthcare workers  .

From 2015 to 2016, there was a 25.4% decrease, whereas from 2016 to 2017, it decreased by 48.7%, which translates into a 50% decrease between the two periods. is also complements the findings reported by of Da'ar and Ahmed in their paper  . e predominance of infection in males was also observed in another study pwefromed in KSA (2015), which reported the percentage of confirmed cases among males to be 66%, compared with 34% among females  .It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia defines age categories differently from the WHO (children: 0-14, adult: otherwise)  .\",\n",
       "  'However, unlike the classification used in Saudi Arabia, we have followed the WHO categorization of age to differentiate between children/adolescents (0 to 19 years) and adults (20 years and older) as indicated in WHO reports for age-standardized population and in infectious diseases  . is categorization was also followed by Aly and his collaborators in their recent paper published in 2017  . Adults were further subcategorized into three groups according to the age distribution of the study population using the following two cutoff points (age of 41 and age of 60)  .ese data agreed with a previous surveillance study, which stated that the majority of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported among people aged 40 and above  . In 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. Moreover, the study which was conducted in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh (KFMC) between January 2012 and December 2013 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children  .',\n",
       "  'e study which was conducted across the Gulf countries for four years by Mahmoud Aly et al. between 2012 and 2016 suggests that the prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV were the highest-risk in elderly aged 60 years or above  . Similar to our results, this study also reported the highest number of confirmed cases during the summer season  .Among confirmed cases, only 25.2% were healthcare workers, whereas around 75% were non-healthcare workers.is is in agreement with the study done by Ahmad to estimate the survival rate in MERS-CoV globally prior to 26 January 2017; 86.9% were not health-care workers compared with 13.1% confirmed cases of healthcare workers  . Similarly, other studies also reported a lower prevalence in healthcare workers    .Our data reported a higher prevalence of infection among Saudi nationals as compared with non-Saudi. Another study also showed similar results but with a much higher percentage among Saudis, which may be due to the fact that it included Saudis from all regions  .',\n",
       "  'ere is no finding basis for comparison as such, because our study was focused on the Riyadh and Al Qassim regions only.In our study, we detected a low prevalence (0.5%). e low positive predictive value of our lab results is not related to the low sensitivity and specificity of the lab assay. e estimated analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Real Star kit from Altona was reported to be 100% with no cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens  . Moreover, this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. In fact, this research is just the starting point to shed the light on more factors that might help in putting more descriptive criteria to lower the financial and human resources burden.To the best of our knowledge, no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study.',\n",
       "  'However, it is worth mentioning that Ahmed et al. developed a risk prediction model that encompasses risk factors such as chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  . However, further investigations are needed to confirm our findings.One of the major strengths of our study is that it is a comprehensive regional study which included all the suspected cases of MERS-CoV in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions. Secondly, the external validity of our study is also expected to be high, as it covers the two regions completely, meaning that the records of all suspected cases in these two main regions in Saudi Arabia were included. irdly, the quality of the data is considered to be high, given that the contagious and life-threatening nature of this disease has led to strict obedience to rules which are enforced in a timely manner, thus ensuring accurate reporting of suspected cases.',\n",
       "  'In addition to this, quality assurance policies are implemented at HESN in order to maintain the highest level of validity and reliability of the data collection process. e variables available for suspected cases were limited to demographics, which limited the scope of our research, but they provided valuable information to form a basis for future studies of a broader scope. Variables such as primary/secondary infections are vital pieces of information, but due the limitation of the data available, we could not determine their effects.According to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have specifically investigated MERS-CoV risk factors in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim areas (two major regions in KSA). Given that all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study, we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence.',\n",
       "  'It must be noted that the comparative group of this study is different from that of the previous ones, as we compared those with confirmed MERS-CoV with those with suspected MERS-CoV who have passed all stages of screening at the hospital, whereas other studies were hospital but not lab-based with an aim of identifying factors that help in suspecting rather than confirming cases. is might be the reason why we have found some significant demographic factors unlike other reports.In conclusion, this research is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only, meaning that the factors we found can help in identifying suspected cases that may have a higher chance of testing positive. is will help primary healthcare professionals to develop a better screening tool for suspected cases, as currently only a small minority of suspected cases are confirmed positive via lab results, consequently resulting in a lot of resources being spent to test thousands of samples, just for the identification of a few cases.',\n",
       "  'e three factors we identified are important because, for example, a female, aged 18, presenting in winter will be less likely to be diagnosed than a male, aged 45, presenting in the summer, or, to give another example, a 60-year-old male who is presenting MERS-CoV signs with a negative lab result may need retesting.Our study covered two main regions in Saudi Arabia and provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in these two regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for prevention and management of such contagious diseases. Our results showed that only a minority of suspected cases are actually diagnosed with the disease, meaning that the procedures being implemented seemed to be highly sensitive but not highly specific. e majority of confirmed cases were male, aged 41 to 60 years, and presented to healthcare facilities in the summer.',\n",
       "  'Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions in Saudi Arabia, to explore potential preventable risk factors and go deeper to know the underlying factors that make male aged 41-60 more susceptible than others.e laboratory data used to support the findings of this study were provided by Riyadh Regional Laboratory under license and are not freely available.

       " ['Cotton rats are an important animal model to study infectious diseases. They have demonstrated higher susceptibility to a wider variety of human pathogens than other rodents and are also the animal model of choice for pre-clinical evaluations of some vaccine candidates. However, the genome of cotton rats remains to be fully sequenced, with much fewer genes cloned and characterised compared to other rodent species. Here we report the cloning and characterization of CD40 ligand, whose human and murine counterparts are known to be expressed on a range of cell types including activated T cells and B cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, macrophages and platelets and exerts a broad array of immune responses. The cDNA for cotton rat CD40L we isolated is comprised of 1104 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 783bp coding for a 260 amino acid protein. The recombinant cotton rat CD40L protein was recognized by an antibody against mouse CD40L.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, it demonstrated functional activities on immature bone marrow dendritic cells by upregulating surface maturation markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86), and increasing IL-6 gene and protein expression. The availability of CD40L gene identity could greatly facilitate mechanistic research on pathogen-induced-immunopathogenesis and vaccine-elicited immune responses.Text: The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) was first used in polio research in the 1930s  , and throughout the last century, it has proven to be an excellent model for biomedical research [2, 3, 4] . Historically in biomedical research, the mouse has been exploited as the default animal model. This is in part due to its well defined immunological and genetic information, costeffectiveness, and abundant inbred strains and research reagents. However, the use of mice as models to study infectious diseases has its limitation since mice are not naturally infected by most human pathogens.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, cotton rat is susceptible to many human pathogens and is the ideal model of choice for measles (paramyxovirus)  , herpes simplex (oral a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 and ophthalmic)  , influenza (orthomyxovirus) [7, 8] , HIV-1  , RSV (respiratory syncytial virus)  , adenovirus [11, 12] , human parainfluenza  , and human metapneumovirus  . This model has been valuable for adenovirus-based gene replacement therapy research [15, 16] , and was also proven to be indispensable in pre-clinical evaluation of the prophylactic antibodies (RespiGam 1  , and Synagis 1  . Indeed, the cotton rat model was found to be valuable in terms of its biological and immunological relevance, it was deemed unnecessary to test the adenovirus-based gene therapy and the Synagis 1 prophylactic treatment against RSV disease in non-human primate prior to the human trials [19, 20] .A number of methods and reagents have been developed for the analysis of immune responses in cotton rats over the last decade.',\n",
       "  'Up to date, more than 200 genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, cell surface markers and regulatory molecules have been cloned, with various related research reagents being commercially available. As a result, the use of cotton rats in pathogenesis studies addressing mechanistic questions has significantly increased. Nevertheless, the gene encoding CD154 and CD40 ligand (CD40L), remains elusive.CD40L plays a critical role in orchestrating immune responses against pathogens. Depending on the post-translational modification, the murine CD40L is a 32-39 kDa type II membrane glycoprotein that was initially identified as a surface marker exclusive to activated CD4 + T cells [21, 22] . It is a member of the TNF superfamily consisting of a sandwiched extracellular structure composed of a β-sheet, α-helix loop, and a β-sheet, allowing for the trimerization of CD40L, an additional feature of the TNF family of ligands  .',\n",
       "  'Since its initial discovery, CD40L has been shown to be not only expressed on CD4+ T cells, but on dendritic cells (DCs)  , B cells  , and platelets  .It has been shown that upon interacting with its receptor, CD40, CD40L induces profound effects on T cells, DCs, B cells, endothelial cells, as well as many cells of the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic systems. Moreover, when CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of DCs, it promotes cytokine production, the induction of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules, and facilitates the cross-presentation of antigen by these cells  , enabling DCs to mature and effectively induce the activation and differentiation of T cells. When CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of B cells, it promotes germinal center formation, immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching, somatic hypermutation to enhance antigen affinity, and lastly, the formation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells  .Various studies have been conducted to utilize gene delivery of CD40L to DCs and tumor cells for tumor immunotherapy.',\n",
       "  'It was found that expression of CD40L in a small proportion of tumor cells was sufficient to generate a long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immune response in mice that was shown to be dependent on cytotoxic T lymphocytes [29, 30] .Here we report the successful cloning of the gene encoding cotton rat CD40L (crCD40L); we also expressed and purified the CD40L produced in mammalian cells. Further characterisation of the recombinant cotton rat CD40L revealed its functional activities in promoting DC maturation and cytokine production. weeks old cotton rats were obtained from an inbred colony maintained at Envigo (USA). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Health Canada Ottawa Animal Care Committee which approved this study.

As shown in Fig 3a, crCD40L has a putative tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily Using EZmol software  , we predicted folding of the protein as shown in Fig 3b. The cotton rat CD40L cDNA that we have isolated was a 1104 nucleotide sequence with a poly-A tail containing an ORF of 783bp which coded for a 260 aa protein. The homology of cotton rat CD40L, at both the amino acid and nucleic acid level, is closer to members of the Cricetidae family (hamster and deer mouse) than to those of the Muridae family (rat and mouse) as shown in Fig 2b. As with other known CD40L proteins, there is a putative TNF superfamily domain, a transmembrane domain, trimerization sites, and receptor binding sites  .TNF superfamily members include TNF (TNF-alpha), LT (lymphotoxin-alpha, TNF-beta), CD40 ligand, Apo2L (TRAIL), Fas ligand, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) ligand, among others  .',\n",
       "  'The TNF superfamily is composed of 19 ligands and 29 receptors, in which each has vastly diversified roles in the body and exhibit pro-inflammatory activity, partly via activation of NF-kB  . Members of this family generally have an intracellular N-terminal domain, a short transmembrane segment, an extracellular stalk, and a globular TNF-like extracellular domain of about 150 residues  . They initiate apoptosis by binding to related receptors, some of which have intracellular death domains  . These proteins typically form homo-or hetero-trimeric complexes and bind one elongated receptor molecule along each of three clefts formed by neighboring monomers of the trimer and ligand trimerization is for receptor binding [23, 39] . All seven known conserved residues that constitute the trimer interface on the conserved TNF domain [23, 40] , were mapped to the putative crCD40L protein sequence.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, all six known conserved receptor binding sites on the conserved TNF domain [23, 40] , were mapped to the crCD40L protein sequence.In order to further evaluate the crCD40L deduced sequence, the full 783bp ORF of the crCD40L was cloned into a vaccinia virus vector. The crCD40L construct was designed to carry a secretion signal, histidine tag, and a trimerization motif (Fig 4a) . Selection and purification of the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the CD40L construct was conducted in BHK21 cells. Western blot with anti-histidine antibody (Ab) was used to confirm expression of the CD40L protein construct Fig 4b and S2 Fig. The resulting 36 kDa protein product was found in both the cell lysate and supernatant (faint band-48 hours only). Since the highest expression was found in the cell lysate, it was used for further purification of the protein. It should be noted that the protein was only able to be detected under reducing conditions.',\n",
       "  'Under non-reducing conditions, the protein was unable to be detected by the anti-histidine Ab, even in the cell lysate (data not shown). This indicates that the histidine tag is folded within the trimer and is unavailable in the native form for purification. This is an additional reason for the need to purify the protein from the cell lysate under harsh denaturing conditions followed by protein refolding. The reason we utilized a mammalian expression system to produce the protein rather than a bacterial system is to facilitate its proper folding into its native structure, trimerization, and glycosylation. The aa backbone predicts a protein of 29 kDa, yet initial studies of the CD40L protein suggested a molecular mass of 39 kDa, and on most cell types the molecular mass of CD40L is 32-33kDa, consistent with extensive post-translation modification  .The BHK21 cells expressing the crCD40L construct were collected and lysed with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride with reduced glutathione and sonication.',\n",
       "  'The lysate was loaded on the nickel column and the washed with denaturing buffer as described in materials and methods. The bound proteins were refolded on the column with gradient buffer exchange, to allow slow refold the protein, given that CD40L biological activity is dependent on a homo-trimer configuration  . The resulting bound protein was subsequently eluted with imidazole. The resulting fractions that showed a peak were pooled and dialysed against PBS.The purified protein was confirmed in ELISA. Since the cotton rat CD40L protein sequence shared 82% identity with the mouse CD40L protein sequence, an Ab known to detect mouse CD40L was used to identify the purified crCD40L protein. The purified recombinant crCD40L was used as a coating antigen in a concentration gradient manner, and was detected with an Ab generated against the mouse CD40L at all concentrations ( Fig 5) . Uncoated controls were performed in parallel and were negative for CD40L in ELISA.',\n",

The avidity of the cotton rat CD40L for the anti-mouse CD40L antibody was decreased in the presence of 6M urea at all concentrations. Clearly, as the antibody used was raised against mouse CD40L, the crCD40L is detected by mouse CD40L. crCD40L was expressed in vaccinia virus and purified from infected BHK21 cell lysate on a nickel column. The purified protein was detected by ELISA using a mouse antibody against CD40L in a concentration gradient dependent manner. The avidity of the mouse CD40L antibody to the cotton rat CD40L protein was evaluated in the presence of 6M urea.

We conducted experiments based on known functional activities of CD40L in other animal species. Specifically, maturation of immature DCs after exposure to antigen is known to play a crucial role in their immunity-stimulating function  , while trimeric recombinant CD40L has been shown to stimulate DC immunomodulating functions  . When CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of DCs, it promotes cytokine production, the induction of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules, and facilitates the cross-presentation of antigen by these cells  . In addition, CD11c is a DC integrin marker and upon stimulation, is down-regulated  .',\n",

Moreover, mouse I-A d major histocompatibility complex is also up-regulated upon stimulation with CD40L  . When our recombinant crCD40L was used to stimulate immature murine bone marrow DCs, we observed similar results to that when murine CD40L is used (Tables 1 and 2 ). CD11c was down regulated in both median flouresence intensity (Table 1 ) and the percentage of positive cells ( Table 2 ). The co-stimulatory molecules CD54, CD40, CD80, and CD86 were all up-regulated in both median fluorescence intensity (Table 1 ) and the percentage of positive cells ( Table 2 ). The Mouse I-A d major histocompatibility complex was upregulated in median fluorescence intensity (Table 1) but not up-regulated in terms of the overall percentage of positive cells (Table 2) .',\n",
       "  'We speculate this to be due to the species incompatibility since we are stimulating mouse bone marrow cells with cotton rat CD40L. Nevertheless, the crCD40L was able to promote up-regulation of key co-stimulatory markers on immature DCs promoting DC maturation. The gating strategy used for the flow cytometry analysis is provided in S3 Fig along with overlapping histograms of the intracellular adhesion marker and co-stimulatory markers. CD40-induced activation of cytokine gene expression in DCs by CD40L is an important process in the initiation of primary immune responses and is critical for DC maturation and the generation of antigen-specific T cell responses  . IL-6 is a highly pleiotropic cytokine in that it stimulates the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells, and furthermore, modifies DC function and survival     . We tested if the recombinant crCD40L could induce IL-6 gene expression (Fig 6a) and production of the cytokine (Fig 6b) by immature murine bone marrow DCs.',\n",
       "  'The results indicate that a significant increase in both IL-6 gene expression and cytokine production in immature murine bone marrow DCs was observed forty hours after stimulation with the crCD40L. Collectively, the observation that both the upregulation of immature DC cell surface maturation markers and increased IL-6 gene expression and cytokine production provide strong evidence of the biological activity of crCD40L.In summary, the cotton rat CD40L cDNA that we isolated was a 1104 nucleotide sequence with a poly-A tail containing an ORF of 783 bp which coded for a 260 aa protein. The recombinant cotton rat CD40L was recognized by an Ab against mouse CD40L in direct ELISA, and showed biological activity by upregulating maturation markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86) as well as I-A d on immature bone marrow murine DCs and moreover, inducing upregulation of IL-6 gene and cytokine expression in these cells.The isolation of the cotton rat CD40L sequence and availability of CD40L has the potential to positively impact basic immunological research and vaccine development, given the critical importance of this protein in orchestrating immune responses [51, 52] .'],\n",

Recent researches revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on. RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle.',\n",

According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV.Text: Synonymous codons are not used randomly  . The variation of codon usage among ORFs in different organisms is accounted by mutational pressure and translational selection as two main factors [2, 3] . Levels and causes of codon usage bias are available to understand viral evolution and the interplay between viruses and the immune response  . Thus, many organisms such as bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, and mammals, have been studied in great detail up on codon usage bias and nucleotide composition  . However, same researches in viruses, especially in animal viruses, have been less studied.',\n",
       "  'It has been observed that codon usage bias in human RNA viruses is related to mutational pressure, G +C content, the segmented nature of the genome and the route of transmission of the virus  . For some vertebrate DNA viruses, genome-wide mutational pressure is regarded as the main determinant of codon usage rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets  . Analysis of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) late genes has revealed a relationship between codon usage and tRNA availability  . In the mammalian papillomaviruses, it has been proposed that differences from the average codon usage frequencies in the host genome strongly influence both viral replication and gene expression  . Codon usage may play a key role in regulating latent versus productive infection in Epstein-Barr virus  . Recently, it was reported that codon usage is an important driving force in the evolution of astroviruses and small DNA viruses [10, 11] .',\n",
       "  'Clearly, studies of synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal much about the molecular evolution of viruses or individual genes. Such information would be relevant in understanding the regulation of viral gene expression.Up to now, little codon usage analysis has been performed on Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which is the pathogen causing Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) or viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD), a highly infectious and often fatal disease that affects wild and domestic rabbits. Although the virus infects only rabbits, RHD continues to cause serious problems in different parts of the world. RHDV is a single positive stranded RNA virus without envelope, which contains two open reading frames (ORFs) separately encoding a predicted polyprotein and a minor structural protein named VP10  . After the hydrolysis of self-coding 3C-like cysteinase, the polyprotein was finally hydrolyzed into 8 cleavage products including 7 nonstructural proteins and 1 structural protein named as VP60 [13, 14] .',\n",

In this report, we sought to address the following issues concerning codon usage in RHDV: (i) the extent and causes of codon bias in RHDV; (ii) A possible genotyping of RHDV; (iii) Codon usage bias as a factor reducing the expression of VP10 and (iiii) the evolution of the ORFs.The 30 available complete RNA sequences of RHDV were obtained from GenBank randomly in January 2011.',\n",

The codons with RSCU value higher than 1.0 have positive codon usage bias, while codons with value lower than 1.0 has relative negative codon usage bias. As RSCU values of some codons are nearly equal to 1.0, it means that these codons are chosen equally and randomly.The index GC3s means the fraction of the nucleotides G+C at the synonymous third codon position, excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons.The ENC, as the best estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias  , was calculated for the quantification of the codon usage bias of each ORF  .',\n",

The values of dn, ds and ω (dn/ds) were calculated in MEGA4.0  .Multivariate statistical analysis can be used to explore the relationships between variables and samples. In this study, correspondence analysis was used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among ORFs. In this study, the complete coding region of each ORF was represented as a 59 dimensional vector, and each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon (excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons)  .Correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between nucleotide composition and synonymous codon usage pattern  .',\n",

The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. METHODS: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36–3.00) and upper RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22–1.96).',\n",

RTIs are divided into upper RTIs (URTIs) including common cold, pharyngitis, otitis, sinusitis, laryngotracheitis, epiglottitis and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including bronchitis, pneumonia and bronchiolitis  . Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [4, 5] and vitamin D status [6, 7] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk.',\n",

This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide  and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity  . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes. Thus, obesity was associated with non-allergic rhinitis  and influenza like-illness  . Moreover, two population-based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [10, 11] .

The ten specific RTI symptom categories were considered with the binary symptom indicators \"infection reported\" or \"no infection reported\" for each month.When counting the episodes for the outcome indicator \"≥3 long lasting infections\", different infection symptoms were counted as separate episodes, even if they overlapped in time.

If an individual RTI symptom was reported, but information on duration was missing, it was counted as \"reported infection with duration < 2 weeks\". If all items were missing, no diary score was computed.

Further information on the study population and completed diaries is reported in Table 1 and Additional file 4.Missing rates of single items in the returned diaries were limited and ranged from 1.2% for rhinitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis to 2.6% for other acute respiratory infections. Study participants reported most frequently rhinitis (26.6%), followed by influenza-like illness (11.4%) and pharyngitis/laryngitis (10.5%), whereas pleurisy (0.10%) was rarely experienced.',\n",

Seasonal patterns of reported infections show a February peak for two of the three assessed infection seasons (2012/13 and 2014/15, see Additional file 5). Respiratory infections with a high fraction of long duration were almost exclusively LRTIs, namely pneumonia (59%), followed by bronchitis (48.2%). Men were overrepresented among those with long-lasting RTIs ( Table 2) .Compared to normal weight individuals, overweight and obese people consistently had a higher prevalence (Table 3) for the single RTIs, URTIs, LRTIs, as well as the other outcome parameters we looked at with other acute infections and pneumonia as the exceptions. For pneumonia, only obese subjects had a higher prevalence. The overweight group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and obesity ( Table 3 ).',\n",

Long-lasting RTIs, frequent RTIs and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with obesity than the individual symptoms. Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates. Among subjects with an infection, long lasting infections were again associated with obesity, reaching significance for any RTI, rhinitis, pharyngitis/laryngitis, influenza-like illness, and bronchitis ( Table 3) .For a better understanding of the robustness of the relationship between RTI burden and obesity, the effect of adjusting for putative confounders was explored (Additional file 6). The studied demographic and lifestyle variables (age, gender, education level, smoking status, contact to children, asthma, sports activity, dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs) did only marginally affect ORs.',\n",

Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available (n = 508), had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between obesity and RTI outcomes.The association between obesity and RTI outcomes was more prominent for women than for men and reached statistical significance only for the former (Table 4 ). For most outcomes this interaction was not significant, with the individual level diary score as an exception. When looking at sports activity, for most outcomes the association with obesity was confined to those physically more active and not seen for those reporting little sports activity (Table 5 ). For all outcomes the association was less pronounced in the latter group (compare the ratios of ORs in Table 5 ), a difference that reached significance for all outcomes except those with low prevalence.',\n",
       "  'Typically the prevalence of an outcome was only increased in the small group of people with obesity and higher sports activity whereas all other groups presented rather similar patterns. Similarly, the prevalence of outcomes was increased among people with obesity and a more favourable nutritional pattern, but comparable among the other groups ( Table 6 ). The interaction reaches significance for the majority of outcomes.RTIs constitute an important morbidity factor considering the high health care costs, the time lost from work, and the impaired quality of life among those recurrently affected [1, 2, 17] . Obesity belongs to one of the host risk factors for RTI and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. In the present study, we report on the association of obesity with individual RTIs as well as with a diary score summarising different incident RTI symptoms over a period of 18 months.',\n",

An elevated risk for sinusitis among obese was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women  . None of the two Danish population-based studies [12, 13] used ORs of monthly prevalence, but hazard ratios (HRs), as they could identify events on a daily basis. The HR of 1.6  for the association with RTIs and the HR of 1.48  for the association with URTIs are, however, of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed. Mechanistically, excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [19, 20] . The here observed associations were more prominent for LRTIs compared to URTIs, but evident for both, and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent RTIs compared to single symptoms.',\n",
       "  \"Based on the infection diary data, we generated a RTI diary score summing-up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month, per whole season or over the whole period of three years. Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome, associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms, and interactions were more pronounced. Moreover, the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three-years score, arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection-prone sub-group of the population. Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual's risk for RTI. Among them, cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [4, 5] . Frequent contact to small children [21, 22] , vitamin D deficiency [23, 24] , and lack of physical activity [25, 26] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks.\",\n",
       "  'Moreover, higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP  . Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders. The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, educational status, contact to children, smoking status, sports activity and nutrition scores, suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections. Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably. This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non-obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences. In addition, some chronic diseases, foremost asthma and COPD, are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity      .',\n",
       "  'Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma, COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score. Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes. Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co-morbidities with both. We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women. A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort  . Several lines of research support this notion: Szabova et al. and Ilavska et al. reported gender-dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [33, 34] . The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men  .',\n",
       "  'NK cells (CD3-/CD16+/CD56+), represent first-line cells for the clearing of virus-infected cells. Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women, but not for respective men, might underlie the gender effect seen in our study. We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition. Interestingly, an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity. Thus, only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non-obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes. We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity, but not in normal weight individuals. Evidence supporting this has been previously published  .',\n",
       "  \"An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection  and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy-deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections  .A similar surprising result was found when studying the effect modification by dietary patterns. Here we queried the participants' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al.  . Aware of the limitations of a one-time assessment of a habitual diet, we found a more pronounced relationship between obesity and infections among obese people who reported an apparent healthier diet. Thus, again only the group of obese individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of RTIs.\",\n",
       "  'The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without RTIs may explain the puzzle. One can imagine that obese individuals may have an increased perception of RTI related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by excess weight and frequent infections. On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non-obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation. Alternatively, among the group of people with obesity a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both, excess body weight and proneness to infections.As strengths of our study we count 1) its sample size, allowing for the analysis of effect modification, 2) its prospective design involving 18 months infection diaries for the exploration of the relationship between BMI and subsequent RTI frequency and severity, 3) the comprehensive information on lifestyle and co-morbidities allowing to study the interplay of such factors on their effect on infections, and 4) the wide range of outcome indicators considered.',\n",
       "  ' The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of airway infection morbidity, studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different RTI outcomes. In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research, our study suffers from some limitations, including the reliance on self-reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification. However, we found -for instance -a good agreement between BMI derived from self-reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub-cohort (n = 508). Moreover, differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between obesity and RTIs is rather unexpected in this setting. The disproportional selection of women into the study may negatively impact the generalizability of some of our results.'],\n",

       "  'But this perception acknowledges that an accountable global body will always be needed to promote, set standards in, and evaluate progress toward better health for people in all countries. The next Director-General will need to heed critics of the organization and craft a process of streamlining and restructuring to produce a new WHO that is demonstrably effective in leading responses to threats to health, and efficient in doing so. As Gostin commented to PLOS Medicine, \"WHO urgently needs a bold reform agenda to fix long-standing problems recognized by every independent group that has evaluated the Organization.\" Political machinations and the enemy within, bureaucracy, are likely to impede reform. For example, WHO\\'s regional and country offices are seen by some as unaccountable, yet the agency of the future will need to be connected and responsive to the resources and needs of all constituent countries.',\n",
       "  'As Gostin also noted, \"[WHO] has failed to include civil society in its governance, unlike. . .newer organizations. \"WHO\\'s next Director-General should be a proven leader and advocate, perhaps from a lowincome or middle-income country. The new recruit will be greeted by a full in-tray, and featuring prominently are likely to be the constraints imposed by WHO\\'s current funding mechanisms. A substantial proportion of WHO\\'s existing budget is earmarked for specific projects, leaving the organization with little financial flexibility to respond to unanticipated demands. However, any improved funding mechanism is likely to follow, and be dependent on, organizational reform. According to Kruk, \"WHO is both essential and hamstrung. . .the election of the Director-General should be a moment for member countries and other funders to reflect on whether they want an implementation agency for their favored health agenda, or an independent institution with the intelligence, agility, and operational capacity to tackle the coming global health challenges.\"',\n",
       "  \"Above all, the incoming leader of WHO will need to be open-minded and creative. More than one of the experts we contacted emphasized the fluid nature of the threats to human health to which WHO should shape the world's response. WHO must be able to lead responses in some areas of global health, but, in other areas, working together with more nimble and focused organizations will be pragmatic. Large-scale infectious disease outbreaks are continuing, and noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, dementia, and mental illnesses, are growing in prevalence and increasing demand for treatment and care. The resources and ingenuity of researchers and clinicians will need to be harnessed, and interventions adapted to new settings, with much greater dynamism. The secular issues of population ageing, conflict, climate change, migration, and others will produce health problems that only an organization with a global reach, responsible to all, can hope to meet.\"],\n",
       " ['Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, despite advances in prevention and management. Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.Text: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades.',\n",
       "  'Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013  . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.The overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015  .',\n",
       "  'Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010  . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study  . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013  . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention  .Notwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur.',\n",
       "  'The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries  . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital  . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .Childhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function  . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] .',\n",
       "  \"A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups  . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity  , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event  because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization's (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia  .\",\n",
       "  'The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia  . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998  .',\n",
       "  'In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia  , 25% in South Africa  and 26% in the Philippines  .The WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia  .',\n",
       "  'A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination  . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America  , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa  .',\n",
       "  'Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.Empyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A  . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008  . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010)  . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005  .',\n",

Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years  ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .Several national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia    . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia  .In addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization  .',\n",
       "  'An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65%  . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults  .A systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus  .More recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism.',\n",
       "  'Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate  . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa  , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden  . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases  . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus  . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls.',\n",
       "  'Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens  .Another etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries  . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series  . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years  .',\n",
       "  'In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015  . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis  , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection  .Similarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases  .',\n",
       "  'Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.Childhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors  . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries  . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries.',\n",
       "  'Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times  . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available  .The single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",
       "  'HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children  . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher      .The pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%.',\n",
       "  \"By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations  . To address this issue, the WHO's Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations  .Maternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis  . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh  and 50.4% in South Africa  ).\",\n",

Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way  . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality  .Improved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children  . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals  .',\n",

Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission  . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children  . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior  . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025  .Case management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics.',\n",
       "  'When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality  . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed    and others are ongoing  . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group  . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial  .',\n",
       "  \"This has been reflected in British  and Spanish  national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia  . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions  .Use of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20%  .\",\n",
       "  'Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research  . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities  , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children  .Much progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths.',\n",

RESULTS: The assay's cut-off using an ELISA and RNA HCV-negative samples was found to be 1.25 log, corresponding to a dilution of 1:18. The assay was compared with a commercial HCV ELISA and exhibited specificity and sensitivity values of 100% and 96.5%, respectively, and good reproducibility (with intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 6.7% and 12.6%, respectively). The assay did not show any cross-reactivity with anti-HIV, anti-HBs or heterophile antibody-positive samples. The neutralizing antibodies titers were 2.13 log (1:134) for homologous samples from HCV genotype 2 infected patients harboring the same genotype as JFH-1 and 1.93 log (1:85) for heterologous samples from patients infected by genotypes other than type 2. These results confirm the presence of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies already reported using the HCV pseudoparticles system.\",\n",
       "  'CONCLUSION: This study presents a simple, specific and reproducible cell culture-based assay for determination of HCV-neutralizing antibodies in human sera. The assay should be an important tool for gauging the relationship between the neutralizing antibodies response and viral load kinetics in acutely or chronically infected patients and for investigating the possible eradication or prevention of HCV infection by neutralizing antibodies.Text: Hepatitis C virus (HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that preferentially replicates in hepatocytes. At least 170 million people worldwide are persistently infected with hepatitis C virus. Chronic HCV infection is associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  . Antiviral therapy with pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin (the current best therapeutic regimen) is only successful in about 50% of all treated patients.Better knowledge of the viral and host factors that determine HCV clearance or persistence during the acute stage of infection is needed in order to improve antiviral therapy and to develop efficient vaccines.',\n",
       "  \"Studies focusing on innate and cellular immune responses have shown that a sufficiently large HCV inoculum is able to evade, subvert or circumvent the host's defences. At present, the chimpanzee is the only reliable experimental animal model in which the initial post-HCV infection events and the efficacy of vaccine candidates can be evaluated  . It has been shown that HCV-specific T-cell immunity is important in the control of HCV infection [3, 4] . Several studies have indicated a role for humoral immunity in the acute stage of HCV infection but this aspect remains poorly characterized. The E1 and E2 glycoproteins are thought to be the viral attachment proteins and thus the main targets for HCV-neutralizing antibodies; identification of protective epitopes conserved across different strains of HCV is therefore a major challenge in vaccine design. A number of antibodies capable of blocking E2 binding to cells or cell receptors have been described,     some of which neutralize HCV entry in animal or cellular models [9, 10] .\",\n",
       "  'Cell entry has been shown to involve several surface molecules (notably including the tetraspanin CD81 and the SR-BI receptor [11, 12] ), although further studies are needed to better understand how viral entry occurs and how it might be neutralized. Detection of neutralizing antibodies in human blood had been problematical until an efficient and reliable cell culture system for HCV became available. Hence, the development of an in vitro neutralization assay for HCV could be extremely valuable for characterizing the humoral immune response to HCV and for evaluating the potential of passive and active immunization against hepatitis C. Recent studies using an in vitro neutralization assay system (based on infectious retroviral pseudoparticles (HCVpp) bearing HCV envelope glycoproteins) have confirmed that HCV-infected patient sera can indeed neutralize infection [13, 14] . However, it has also been shown that the neutralizing activity of antibodies from HCV-infected patients is attenuated by a factor present in human serum, identified as the highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) fraction [11, 13, 15] .',\n",
       "  \"HDL facilitation of HCVpp entry is a post-binding event  , sug-gesting that HDLs favour internalization of virions and thus the latter's escape from neutralizing antibodies.Recently, an HCV cell culture model (HCVcc) has been developed    , allowing the production of virus particles that can be efficiently propagated in cell culture. Some preliminary neutralization assays have been carried out by these authors. In this study, we describe how we set up a standardized focus reduction neutralization assay based on HCVcc.Focus reduction assays have been widely used to evaluate the neutralizing antibody responses to viruses that can form foci in infected cells. Following the recent development of the HCVcc model, the principle of the focus reduction assay has been applied to HCV-neutralizing antibodies detection. The JFH-1 HCV 2a viral strain was grown on a Huh-7 human hepatoma cell line.\",\n",
       "  'After three days of infection and cell permeabilization, detection of the HCV foci was carried out using an inactivated HCVpositive patient serum primary antibody and a peroxidase-coupled, Fc-specific anti-human IgG-antibody. The reaction was revealed with DAB peroxidase substrate. The viral foci were thus stained brown, making them easy to count (see Fig. 1a ). It has been recently shown that the neutralizing activity of HCV antibodies is attenuated by a serum factor associated with the HDL fraction. Hence, HDLs were able to facilitate HCVpp and HCVcc entry via a mechanism which depended on the expression of the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and its selective lipid-uptake function [11, 15, 16, 20] . In view of the role of HDL in HCV entry, immunoglobulins were purified from each serum sample prior to determination of the neutralizing antibody titer (see Fig.',\n",
       "  \"1b ).The specificity of the HCV neutralization assay was assessed by testing 20 anti-HCV-ELISA-negative samples, including five positive for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies (anti-HBs) and five positive for heterophile antibodies. All samples tested negative with two commercial anti-HCV antibody detection assays (Axsym ® HCV Version 3.0, Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany; Vitros ® Anti-HCV reagent pack, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic, High Wycombe, United Kingdom) and HCV-RNA-negative with a qualitative, commercial assay (Cobas Amplicor HCV test Version 2.0, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France).These anti-HCV-negative samples were compared with 11 samples from patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 2. The neutralization titers of anti-HCV-negative serum samples are shown in Fig. 2 ., with a mean value of 1.083 ± 0.083 (corresponding to a dilution of 1:12). The assay's cut-off (determined as the mean value for negative samples plus two standard deviations) corresponded to a dilution of 1:18. The assay exhibited specificity and sensibility values of 100% and 96.5%, respectively.\",\n",
       "  'The assay did not show any cross-reactivity with anti-HIV, anti-HBs or heterophile antibody-positive samples (data not shown). Conversely, the chronically HCV genotype 2-positive samples displayed strong reactions, with a mean value of 2.128 ± 0.365 (corresponding to a dilution of 1:134) (p < 0.001).Inter-assay variability was determined by testing one HCV genotype 2 sample in 10 consecutive experiments (n = 10), whereas intra-assay variability was evaluated by testing the same sample 10 times (n = 10) in the same experiment, whilst running the dilution series. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of the log neutralization titers were 6.7% and 12.6%, respectively.Fifty-seven HCV-positive antibodies samples were evaluated using the HCV focus reduction neutralization assay. The genotypes were distributed as follows; for types 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5, we studied 11, 11, 11, 12, 10 and 2 samples, respectively. The mean values of the different genotypes is shown in Fig.',\n",
       "  '3 . and Table 1 . The mean log neutralization titers for genotypes 1a, 2 and 3 are very similar (2.046 ± 0.671 for genotype 1a, 2.128 ± 0.365 for genotype 2 and 2.148 ± 0.478 for genotype 3). The mean average values are lower for genotype 1b (1.747 ± 0.462) and genotype 4 (1.786 ± 0.236). Strikingly, very high heterologous titers were observed for five patients -three infected with HCV genotype 1a and two infected with HCV genotype 3 (see Fig. 3a ). There were too few genotype 5 samples to compare with the other genotypes but the corresponding results nevertheless indicate that the neutralization assay is suitable for this genotype. The two The distribution of the log neutralization titers across all the HCV ELISA and RNA-positive samples as a function of the HCV genotype is shown in Fig. 3b .',\n",
       "  'More than 60% of the neutralizing antibodies titers fell in the range from 1.7 to 2.69 log titers, corresponding to dilutions of 1:50 and 1:500, respectively. Overall, 3.5% of the samples displayed a titer greater than log 3.0 (1:1000) and, conversely, 3.5% displayed a titer below the cut-off value, i.e. log 1.25 (1:10). Thus, of 57 HCV-infected patients, only two did not test positive for neutralizing antibodies in this assay (the titers were 0.960 and 0.932, respectively).The role of neutralizing antibodies during acute and chronic viral infection remains an important question and has generated controversial results. Initially, the presence of neutralizing antibodies was shown to control the HCV load and to contribute to viral eradication in patients capable of clearing the infection  . In other studies, the appearance of neutralizing antibodies was delayed and restricted to IgG1 antibodies in patients who develop a chronic infection [2, 21] .',\n",
       "  'The chimpanzee model has been critical for the study of HCV transmission and host immune responses; however, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in some animals that resolved their infection -suggesting a minimal role in viral clearance, as also observed in human studies [14, 15] . Experimentally infected chimpanzees and naturally infected humans can be re-infected with homologous and heterologous HCV strains, suggesting that the humoral immunity that develops after spontaneous resolution of acute hepatitis C is not sterilizing    . During chronic infection in humans, the presence and/or production of neutralizing antibodies do not suffice for curing the infection but could regulate the spread of the virus. Thus, it can be postulated that during chronic infection, viral mutants can continuously escape the renewed production of neutralizing antibodies.Retroviral pseudoparticles have been used to develop a very interesting tool for measuring neutralizing antibodies in vitro  .',\n",
       "  'The assay has demonstrated the presence of HCV-neutralizing antibodies in human sera with relatively high titers (>1:320) and broadly neutralizing activity against different HCV genotypes. However, this model does not represent genuine HCV virions; in particular, the budding of retroviral particles is thought to be very different and may involve a variety of cellular pathways. Characterization of infectious retroviral pseudotype particles bearing HCV glycoproteins have been shown to be very heterogeneous, and so it is possible that these pseudoparticles may not be as relevant as the native HCV virions  .The recent development of a cell culture model for HCV enables the production of native HCV virions that can be efficiently propagated in cell culture    . This cell culture system has allowed us to develop a neutralization assay for evaluating the level and the proportion of HCVneutralizing antibodies in chronically infected HCV patients.',\n",
       "  'We analysed a number of parameters (such as practicability, reproducibility and specificity) and tested the effect of a range of variables (viral inoculum size, incubation time, fixation and permeabilization methods, blocking and revelation reagents) on these parameters (data not shown). Overall, the neutralization assay described in this study performs similarly to standardized neutralization assays for many other viruses    .The assay relies on the ability of the specific JFH-1 genotype 2 viral strain to replicate and multiply on a Huh-7 human hepatoma cell line in a cell culture model, enabling the rapid detection of viral foci after 72 hours of infection. Moreover, no secondary foci were detectable at this time point. Fixation with paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with Triton X-100 were chosen in order to preserve antigenicity and prevent the cell monolayer from detaching during washes. Development with DAB peroxide substrate made it easy to count specifically coloured viral foci.',\n",
       "  \"The viral inoculum size is an important parameter; it has to be low enough to enable good assay sensitivity but high enough to produce a statistically significant number of foci, i.e. allowing the reduction in the number of foci (and thus the effect of neutralization) to be monitored. Thus, 100 FFUs were used as the inoculum in this neutralization assay.In order to test different human samples, we had to take into account the ability of HDL to facilitate HCVcc entry via a mechanism which depends on expression of the scavenger receptor BI [11, 15, 16, 20] . Given HDL's role in HCV entry, immunoglobulins were purified from each serum sample prior to determination of the neutralizing antibodies titer; this frees the assay of the risk of non-specific neutralization activity of the serum via the effects of HDL, the complement system and/or serum amyloid A protein (SAA)  .The HCV neutralization assay exhibited good reproducibility, for both duplicate assays and independent tests.\",\n",
       "  \"As expected, the intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was lower than the interassay CV. The test also showed good specificity, since there was no interaction with anti-HIV, anti-HBV or heterophile antibodies. Very low titers were found with HCV ELISA and RNA-negative samples, and the assay's cut-off was determined as the mean titer for negative samples plus two standard deviations (1.25 log, corresponding to a dilution of 1:18).Given that only the JFH-1 strain of HCV genotype 2a was available for the assay, we evaluated the neutralization titer of sera from patients chronically infected with other HCV genotypes, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Most of these sera were detected as positive by the neutralization assay, except for two sera from HCV genotype 1-infected patients. These two samples presented a high specific antibody ratio according to the ELISA but only very low inhibition by neutralization assay (far below the cut-off, in fact).\",\n",
       "  'We conclude that either the samples lacked neutralizing antibodies or that any such antibodies that were present did not cross-neutralize with HCV genotype 2a.The sensitivity was 100% -not only for genotype 2 (the genotype of the strain used for the assay) but also for other HCV genotypes (except genotype 1). HCV genotype 5 antibodies were also measured but there were too few samples for accurate testing. Moreover, the positive sera (96.5%) had comparable and significantly high titers (1.99 ± 0.63), whatever the genotype. This finding suggests that most neutralizing antibodies are cross-reactive. Another possibility is that most of the patients had been previously infected by a genotype 2 strain. However, this is unlikely because few genotype 2 strains are circulating in France  . As expected for a neutralization test, the assay presented in the present study appeared to be very specific (independently of the genotype) and usable in most circumstances.',\n",
       "  'For most viral infections, neutralization assays such as that described in this study are used as reference assays. Thus, we are confident that as other HCVcc genotypes become available, these assays will replace the pseudoparticle assay in the near future because they are probably more relevant. Our assay is somewhat time-consuming and could be simplified by using one dilution to count the foci; however, this type of \"short cut\" would make it difficult to extrapolate to the dilution neutralizing 50% of the inoculum. Another approach would consist in using recombinant HCV capable of expressing reporter genes (such as luciferase) in order to use a single dilution and obtain a quantitative result  . However, further neutralization studies using other genotypes are needed in order to complete our observations and to char- A simple, specific and reproducible cell culture-based neutralization assay was developed for the determination of neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies in human sera.',\n",

Calf septicemia is the main cause of death in the neonatal period  . Its etiology involves bacteria (commonly Escherichia coli), viruses (rota and coronavirus), parasites, and other factors.

Hepcidin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Fe metabolism  , which is a part of foundational cellular functions and thus of vital importance. On the other hand, by participating in redox reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), Fe also causes oxidative stress. Therefore, Fe has been regarded as a potentially toxic element to cells  . Fe also plays an important role in pathogenesis of bacterial infections as bacteria utilize Fe for survival, growth and proliferation; therefore, it is of paramount importance to control the Fe metabolism  .

Hepcidin is controlled by the presence of inflammation in the body, Fe storage, and erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow and plays a primary role in the homeostasis of Fe  . The increase in tissue and plasma Fe levels stimulates the synthesis of hepcidin and reduces Fe release and enteric Fe absorption from macrophages and hepatocytes  . Increased hepcidin concentrations during inflammation and infection reduce serum Fe levels by decreasing Fe release from macrophages and hepatocytes, and thus Fe required for microorganisms and tumor cells is restricted  .Serum hepcidin levels in calves with suspected septicemia were significantly high before treatment when compared to after treatment; also Fe levels were lower before treatment when compared to after treatment in this study.',\n",

Although no study exists reporting hepcidin concentration in diseased calves, studies in human subjects show that cord blood hepcidin levels might be an important indicator in diagnosing early-onset of neonatal sepsis. The cord blood hepcidin levels of neonatal infants with sepsis varied between 118.1 and 8400 ng/mL and were significantly higher than the healthy infants  .

The role of Fe in the development of oxidative stress may once more show the importance of hepcidin, as an important Fe regulator, with regard to enhancing antioxidant capacity through inhibiting utilization of Fe by the organism as well as the host cells.The antioxidant and oxidative system are in a constant state of balance in the organism.

Similarly, in our study, TAS level was significantly lower and TOS level was significantly higher in diarrheic calves before treatment, and treatment caused corrections in these parameters.

CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old girl known to have sickle cell disease (SCD) presented an acquired demyelinating syndrome (ADS) with diplopia due to sudden unilateral fourth nerve palsy. She received five pulses of IVMP (30 mg/kg/day). Two weeks after steroid weaning, she developed right hemiplegia and coma. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a left frontal necrotico-hemorrhagic lesion and new multifocal areas of demyelination. She underwent decompressive craniotomy and evacuation of an ongoing left frontoparietal hemorrhage. Comprehensive investigations ruled out vascular and infectious process. The neurological deterioration stopped concomitantly with combined neurosurgical drainage of the hematoma, decompressive craniotomy, IVMP, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).',\n",
       "  'She developed during the following months Crohn disease and sclerosing cholangitis. After 2-year follow-up, there was no new neurological manifestation. The patient still suffered right hemiplegia and aphasia, but was able to walk. Cognitive/behavioral abilities significantly recovered. A heterozygous novel rare missense variant (c.4993A>G, p.Lys1665Glu) was identified in RANBP2, a gene associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy. RANBP2 is a protein playing an important role in the energy homeostasis of neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: In any ADS occurring in the context of SCD and/or autoimmune condition, we recommend to slowly wean steroids and to closely monitor the patient after weaning to quickly treat any recurrence of neurological symptom with IVMP. This case report, in addition to others, stresses the likely efficacy of combined craniotomy, IVIG, and IVMP treatments in AHEM. RANBP2 mutations may sensitize the brain to inflammation and predispose to AHEM.Text: Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM) or acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis is considered a rare and extremely severe form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).',\n",
       "  'AHEM is characterized by an acute and rapidly progressive encephalopathy including hemorrhagic necrosis of the parenchyma of the central nervous system. It is usually fatal (1) (2) (3) . Many treatment options have been used including intravenous (IV) steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and plasmapheresis (4) . There have been few reports of survival following early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy and/or decompressive craniotomy (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .RANBP2, a nuclear pore protein, has numerous roles in the cell cycle. RANBP2 is associated with microtubules and mitochondria suggesting roles in intracellular protein trafficking or energy maintenance and homeostasis of neuronal cells. RANBP2 mutations have been reported in acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) which could present with coma, convulsions, and encephalopathy. The hallmark of ANE is multiple, symmetric brain lesions located in the thalami bilaterally, putamina, deep periventricular white matter, cerebellum, and brainstem.',\n",
       "  'It could be triggered by a viral infection in previously healthy children (10) .We report a new case of AHEM associated to a Ran Binding Protein (RANBP)-2 variant and responsive to combined craniectomy, intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), and IVIG as inaugural manifestation of multisystemic autoimmunity in a girl with sickle cell disease (SCD).A 6-year-old girl known for SCD treated on folic acid and hydroxyurea was admitted for new-onset diplopia [day 0 (D0): refers to the start of the diplopia] 6 weeks after respiratory tract infection due to rhinovirus. She was diagnosed with a fourth nerve palsy secondary to an acquired demyelinating syndrome. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at D5 after onset of neurological symptom showed left midbrain and pontine edema with expansion of the brainstem, right caudate nucleus, and scattered supratentorial white matter foci of high T2/FLAIR signal (Figure 1 ). Brain MR angiography (MRA) showed a normal appearing circle of Willis.',\n",
       "  'The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumber puncture was normal (WBC 1 cells/μl, RBC 0 cells/μl, glucose 2.9 mmol/L, protein 0.18 g/L, and absent oligoclonal bands). The infectious workup including blood bacterial culture, CSF bacterial and viral cultures, nasopharyngeal aspirate (tested for Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza 1-2-3, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Metapneumovirus, Enterovirus, and Rhinovirus), and serologies for Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HTLV I, HTLV II, HIV1, and Lyme disease were negative. Bartonella Henselae IgG was positive (1:1,280) reflecting a previously acquired common and self-limited infection in our area. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive (1:160). B12 and folate levels were normal. Smooth muscle antibodies were negative. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies were positive. Sedimentation rate was 65 mm/h. She was treated with five doses of IVMP (30 mg/kg/day) followed by 9 days of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day).',\n",
       "  'At discharge, her neurological exam was significant only for vertical diplopia.She presented 1 month later with 5 days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, fever, headache, and a rapidly progressive right-hand weakness (D30) with normal alertness. She had normal blood pressure (120/81 mmHg). She was started on cefotaxime, vancomycin, and acyclovir. White cell count was 13.4 × 10 9 /L, hemoglobin was 7.8 g/L, and platelets were 239 × 10 9 /L. While in the MRI machine (D30) she deteriorated with vomiting and reduced level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale dropped from 15 to 8 over 30 min). Brain MRI showed a rapid progression over a few sequences of an active bleed involving both superficial and deep gray matter as well as subcortical white matter of the left hemisphere anterior quadrant. Brain MRA was normal (Figures 2A-F) . The patient was immediately brought out of the magnet and her physical exam demonstrated unequal dilated pupils.',\n",
       "  'She received IV mannitol and hypertonic saline for the management of acute intracranial hypertension/ herniation and was taken for surgery. She underwent left frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniotomy, evacuation of left frontoparietal intracerebral hemorrhage, and insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD). Upon opening the skull, there was significant dural tension, and on opening the dura mater, there was a large amount of bleeding, in addition to brain swelling and necrosis. Estimated blood loss was 3.5 L. She received 8 units of packed red blood cells, 3 units of cryoprecipitate, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 3 units of platelets. Coagulation profile showed international normalization ratio = 3.38, prothrombin time = 51.2 s, and partial thromboplastin time = 122 s. An intraventricular pressure monitor was inserted. She returned with stable vitals to PICU. At D31, the CT scan showed extensive multi-compartmental bleed involving the left frontoparietal lobes, the interhemispheric fissure, and the left hemispheric arachnoid spaces.',\n",
       "  'New white matter lesions were detected in the left posterior parietal and occipital lobes and in the left caudate head. MRI at D33 showed interval worsening with disseminated gray and white matter non-hemorrhagic lesions in the right cerebral and both cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral deep gray nuclei, as well as new necrotic non-hemorrhagic lesions in the left hemisphere (Figures 2G-I) . She was started on IVMP (30 mg/kg/ day for 5 days) and IVIG (1 g/kg/day for 2 days). Repeat MRI at D9 showed no new parenchymal hemorrhage and partial resolution of the non-hemorrhagic lesions (Figure 3) . Prednisolone was tapered course over 6 weeks. At discharge (D71), she was able to say a few words and had better power of her right side.',\n",
       "  'Brain MRI performed 3 months later showed complete resolution of the non-hemorrhagic non-necrotic lesions, mainly seen in the right cerebral hemisphere and the cerebellum.Brain biopsy of the hematoma, some small vessels, cortex, and white matter showed necrotic area, reactive and non-specific findings which could be entirely explained by compressive changes adjacent to a hematoma. There was diffuse microglial activation and signs of early microinfarcts. Blood, CSF and urine culture, and PCR (HSV1/2) were negative for bacteria and for viruses. CSF obtained through craniotomy and EVD performed at D32 showed elevated proteins 2.56 g/L, glucose 3.6 mmol/L, white blood cells 9 cells/μL, and red blood cells 1,341 cells/μL. ANA and anti-DNA antibody were negative.Anti-extractable nuclear antigens (SSA-RO, SSB-LA, smith, RNP) were negative. Serum autoimmune antibodies panel (NMO, NMDAR, AMPA I/II, GAB, MAG, VGCC, MOG, YO, HU, RI) were negative but GAD antibody was slightly positive, possibly due to the IVIG infusion.',\n",
       "  \"EBV showed no signs of recent infection.After discharge, the patient was started on regular transfusion exchange. Six months later, the patient was diagnosed to have Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Two years later, the patient still suffers right hemiparesis but is able to walk without support. She presents an expressive aphasia. Her intellectual abilities are average, or below the mean but in the normal range, except for the speed of information processing, verbal working memory, and some elaborated executive functions.A gene panel ( Table 1 ) targeting inflammatory disorders and post-infectious necrotic encephalopathies found a heterozygous RANBP2 missense mutation (NM_006267.4, c.4993A>G, p.Lys1665Glu). This mutation has not been previously reported in the HGMD database. This variant has been observed at a frequency of <0.01% across the entire Broad ExAC dataset of individuals without severe childhood onset disease (6/117,118 alleles).\",\n",
       "  'Analysis of amino acid conservation indicates that the wild-type amino acid Lys1665 is conserved in 59 of 60 mammals examined, including 12 of 12 primates, and in 25 of 34 nonmammalian vertebrates increasing the likelihood that a change at this position might not be tolerated. In silico tools predict that this variant is damaging (SIFT and Align GVGD).Several differential diagnoses of acute encephalopathy in a patient with sickle cell anemia can be considered. An infectious encephalitis, including herpes encephalitis, was ruled out by blood and CSF bacterial and viral cultures and negative HSV I/ II PCR. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was negative for viruses. Some infections have been previously associated with necrotizing encephalitis such as Influenza A (11) . SCD patients are prone to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes (12) . Primary hemorrhagic stroke is uncommon in pediatric SCD. Most cases were from adults and have been described in the context of previous ischemic stroke, aneurysms, low hemoglobin, acute chest syndrome, and hypertransfusions.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, although hemorrhagic stroke has been described in SCD patients receiving transfusion or corticosteroids, it was in the context of elevated blood pressure which was not present in our case (13) . This was ruled out as the MRI findings were not consistent with a specific vascular territory and normal arterial and venous flows were shown on vascular imaging. Another differential is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome which has been reported in SCD patients (13) (14) (15) (16) . However, it is unlikely in our case due to the severity of the brain injury and the absence of classic precipitating factors of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome such as high blood pressure. Macrophage activation syndrome could also lead to acute necrotic brain injury. However, it is associated to high ferritin and low triglycerides at the time of the encephalopathy, other multisystemic injuries, typical neuropathological findings, and recurrence over time, which were not noted in our patient (17) .',\n",
       "  'Parvovirus B19 has been described to cause encephalopathy in sickle cell patients. It is associated with aplastic anemia. It caused punctate areas of hemorrhages in the basal ganglia, periventricular white matter, and mainly along the posterior parietal cortex. This was attributed to parvovirus B19-induced vasculitis (18) . In our patient, there was no sign of aplasia or any neuroradiological finding of parvovirus B19 infection. Finally, acute encephalitis has been observed in SCD patients in the context of arterial hypoxemia from fat embolism, pulmonary embolism, sudden anemia, or acute chest syndrome due to pneumonia (19) . This was ruled out as the patient did not have clinical or radiological signs of acute chest syndrome or embolism and there was no arterial hypoxemia.Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis has been described in pediatric patients following ADEM or ADEM-like episodes (20, 21) .',\n",
       "  'AHEM is the most plausible diagnosis in our patients based on the clinical and radiological presentation, the preceding ADEM-like episode, and the exclusion of other etiologies of acute encephalopathy. Other patients with AHEM have been described in the SCD context (7, 19) . Many treatment options have been used to treat AHEM; of these, IV steroids have been associated with survival following aggressive, high-dose corticosteroid therapy (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (22) (23) (24) (25) .Autosomal dominant mutations (with incomplete penetrance) in RANBP2 have been associated with susceptibility to infectioninduced necrotizing encephalopathy (26, 27) . Previously healthy patients with pathogenic mutations in RANBP2 can present acutely with encephalopathy and convulsions in the context of an infection, with brain imaging revealing involvement of the brainstem, thalami, putamina, cerebellum and external capsules, and claustrum (10) . Our patient has a similar presentation and imaging features as infection-induced necrotizing encephalopathy, including bilateral thalamic involvement.',\n",
       "  'The rare heterozygous previously unreported variant we identified in RANBP2 affects a very conserved aminoacid and is predicted deleterious using in silico tools (a prediction tool performing a fast bioinformatics analysis which can predict the pathogenicity of a variant based on the change to an amino acid). It is possible that this variant is pathogenic and responsible for the clinical phenotype. There is an overlap between the diagnostic criteria of AHEM and those of acute hemorrhagic encephalopathy (25, 26) making possible that both entities might be part of the same pathophysiological continuum. RANBP2 is a protein playing an important role in the energy homeostasis of neuronal cells (28) . Hence, RANBP2 dysfunction might make neuronal cells much vulnerable to energy failure and necrosis when exposed to inflammatory or other stresses, such as those implicated in AHEM.This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of our institutional ethic committee.',\n",

All isoxazolidines were assessed for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Isoxazolidines trans-11f/cis-11f (90:10), trans-11h and trans-11i/cis-11i (97:3) showed weak activity (EC(50) = 6.84, 15.29 and 9.44 μM) toward VZV (TK(+) strain) which was only one order of magnitude lower than that of acyclovir used as a reference drug. Phosphonates trans-11b/cis-11b (90:10), trans-11c, trans-11e/cis-11e (90:10) and trans-11g appeared slightly active toward cytomegalovirus (EC(50) = 27–45 μM). Compounds containing benzyl substituents at N3 in the quinazolinone skeleton exhibited slight antiproliferative activity towards the tested immortalized cells with IC(50) in the 21–102 μM range.Text: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles form the core of natural products (e.g., alkaloids) and they are also present in many pharmacophores as well as in numerous marketed drugs.',\n",

Several reviews focused on the synthetic strategies and biological activities of these compounds have been published         . The significant impact of various functional groups installed into quinazoline/quinazolinone frameworks on pharmacological properties have been proven.In the last decades several compounds containing the quinazolin-4-one framework, which exhibited promising anticancer as well as antiviral properties, have been obtained ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, some biologically active substituted quinazolin-4(3H)-ones were isolated from various fungi and bacteria species. For example, 2-(4-hydroxybenzyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1) was found in an entomopathogenic fungus Isaria farinosa and its strong inhibitory properties on the replication of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)  were recognised, whereas its 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) analogue 2 present in fungus from Penicillium genus appeared only slightly active toward TMV  .',\n",

To investigate the distribution of HBoV1 and determine the effect of meteorological conditions, hospitalized pediatric patients were studied in a subtropical region of China. METHODS: Samples from 11,399 hospitalized pediatric patients (≤14 years old), with ARI were tested for HBoV1 and other common respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR, between July 2009 and June 2016. In addition, local meteorological data were collected. RESULTS: Of the 11,399 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Two hundred forty-eight of 11,399 (2.2%) were positive for HBoV1 infection. Co-infection was common in HBoV1-positive patients (45.2%, 112/248). A significant difference in the prevalence of HBoV1 was found in patients in different age groups (p < 0.001), and the peak prevalence was found in patients aged 7–12 months (4.7%, 56/1203).',\n",

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better understanding of the characteristics of HBoV1 infection in children in subtropical regions. Data from this study provide useful information for the future control and prevention of HBoV1 infections.Text: Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), which belongs to family Parvoviridae, was firstly identified in respiratory secretions of children with respiratory tract disease in 2005 [1, 2] . HBoV1 has been confirmed as an important respiratory pathogen and is found in respiratory infections in children and adults worldwide.

HBoV1 can cause both upper respiratory illness (URI) and lower respiratory illness (LRI)        . Infection with HBoV1 can lead to development of a cough, rhinitis, fever and other common clinical symptoms [15, 19] . In some cases, it can cause respiratory distress, hypoxia, wheezing and other severe respiratory symptoms [18, 20] . Clinical diagnosis is mainly pneumonia, bronchitis, pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema and otitis media and other complications      . In some cases, patients develop severe respiratory injury symptoms, which can be fatal [21, 23] . HBoV1 can be detected in fecal samples  , blood samples [25, 26] , urine [27, 28] , cerebrospinal fluid    , river water  and sewage [33, 34] , indicating that HBoV1 may be associate with a variety of diseases.',\n",

The prevalence of respiratory viruses is associated with many factors, including local climate, which may impact the survival and spread of the viruses  .

Epidemiology of HBoV1 in temperate regions has been described in more detail and a high incidence of infection has been observed in children under the age of 2 years in winter and spring [15, 16, 39, 44] .To describe the epidemiology of HBoV1 in Guangzhou, we collected throat swabs from 11,399 children (≤14 years old), hospitalized with ARI and monitored HBoV1 and other common respiratory pathogens over a 7-year period (Table 1 ).In the current study, 86.5% (9857/11399) of patients were under the age of 5 years, with a median age of 1.75 years, indicating that infants and young children were most at risk of ARI, consistent with previous reports [45, 46] .',\n",

In our study, 45.2% (112/248) of HBoV1-positive patients also tested positive for other pathogens (Table 1 ). This may be partly caused by coinciding epidemics of HBoV1 and other pathogens. In our study, the HBoV1 seasonal distribution and total positive pathogen distribution were consistent, confirming this inference (Fig. 2) . Current research shows that HBoV1 infection can lead to the collapse of the first line of defense of airway epithelium    , which may lead to a higher susceptibility to other pathogens, explaining the high rate of co-infection.',\n",

The characteristics of the HBoV1 infection are likely to be a good model for studying the effects of co-infections.In this study, there was a significant difference in prevalence of HBoV1 in patients of different ages (p < 0.001). The majority of HBoV1 infections occurred in patients under 2 years old and the peak frequency of HBoV1 infection occurred in patients aged 7-12 months (Fig. 1) , consistent with previous serological and epidemiological reports on the virus [8-11, 15, 16, 39, 44] . This might be because children's immune systems are still under development and maternal antibodies gradually disappear in this age group. The distribution of HBoV1 in patients of different ages will provide important reference for future vaccines and new drug research and development, as well as providing important data for disease prevention and control.Many factors affect the epidemiology of pathogens, such as geographical location and local climate.\",\n",

       " ['Massive studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cellular biological processes by binding with RNA-related proteins. However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test.',\n",

Highly-ranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.Text: most commonly used approach is guilt-by-association (GBA) 19 , which provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. New emerged methods, including the Katz method 20 , Combining dATa Across species using Positive-Unlabeled Learning Techniques(CATAPULT) 19 , Random Walk with Restart (RWR) 21 , and LncRNA-protein Interaction prediction based on Heterogeneous Network model (LPIHN) 22 , have extended the association from just direct protein interactions to more distant connections in various ways. The KATZ measure 20 is a weighted sum of the number of paths in the network that measures the similarity of two nodes.',\n",
       "  'CATAPULT 19 is a supervised machine learning method that uses a biased support vector machine where the features are derived from walks in a heterogeneous gene-trait network. RWR 21 is a method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of similarities in protein-protein interaction networks and it add weight to the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein interactome that extend beyond the disease proteins themselves. LPIHN 22 is a network-based method by implement a random walk on a heterogeneous network. PRINCE is a global method based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information.',\n",

In this paper, we adopt a method named HeteSim, which is a path-based measure to calculate the relevance between objects in heterogeneous network 25 . The basic idea is that similar objects are more likely to be related to some other objects. Considering the relatedness of heterogeneous objects is path-constrained, HeteSim gives a uniform and symmetric measure for arbitrary paths to evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous object pair (same or different types) with one single score.',\n",
       "  'Due to the relevance path not only captures the semantics information but also constrains the walk path, the score is also a path-based similarity measure.An example of HeteSim score is illustrated in (Fig. 1 ). The number of paths from A to C and B to C is 3 and 2, respectively. The walk count between A and C is larger than B and C, which might indicate that A is more closer to C than B. But the connectivity between B and C is more intense than A and C in the sight of HeteSim score, since most edges starting from B are connected with C, when A only has a small part of edges connected with C.Here, we propose a method named PLPIHS (Fig. 2) to predict lncRNA-Protein interactions using HeteSim scores. We first construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network.',\n",

LOOCV(Leave-One-Out Cross Validation) 26 is implemented on the verified lncR-NA-protein associations to evaluate the performance of LPIHN 22 . We leave a known lncRNA-protein pair in turn as the test sample and all the other known lncRNA-protein pairs are regarded as training samples. In order to improve the accuracy of PLPIHS, we remove all connected lncRNAs and proteins while in each validation round. Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve 27 is used to evaluate the prediction performance, which plots true-positive rate (TPR, sensitivity or recall) versus false-positive rate (FPR, 1-specificity) at different rank cutoffs.',\n",

In this paper, we only have two kinds of objects, lncRNA and protein. Thus, the paths from a lncRNA to a protein in our heterogeneous network with length less than six is listed in Table 1 . In order to pick out the most efficient paths, we compared the performances of these 14 paths under different combinations (Fig. 3) . We can see that all paths achieve a favorable status except path 1′~2′. Path 1′~14′ obtains the best performance across all measures, which means that the path with length greater than three contains more significant meanings.',\n",

Path length equals 3 matches with constant β, path length equals 4 matches with constant β*β and path length equals 5 matches with constant β*β*β. Table 2 shows that β has tiny impact on the final results and β = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 achieved the best AUC score and the others are not far behind yet.To further verify the dependability of our method, we compare the three networks of different connectivity density under different cutoff value 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 (see lncRNA-Protein associations). The results are shown in Fig. 4 . There are tiny performance differences between different sparse networks.

The PLPIHS method. Among a heterogeneous network, different paths can express different semantic meanings. For instance, a lncRNA and a protein is connected via 'lncRNA-lncRNA-protein' path or 'lncRNA-protein-protein' path representing totally different meanings. The former means that if a lncRNA is associated with a protein, then another lncRNA similar to the lncRNA will be potential associated with the protein. The latter shows that if a protein associated with a lncRNA, then another protein interacted with the protein will be likely associated with the lncRNA.\",\n",

       " ['BACKGROUND: Coccidiosis due to Eimeria spp. infections in lambs causes increased mortality and substantial production losses, and anticoccidials are important for control of the infection. Anticoccidial resistance has been reported in poultry and swine, and we recently described reduced toltrazuril efficacy in ovine Eimeria spp. in some Norwegian sheep farms using a newly developed faecal oocyst count reduction test (FOCRT). The aim of the present study was to use a controlled efficacy trial to assess the efficacy of toltrazuril against a field isolate suspected of being resistant. METHODS: Twenty lambs, 17–22 days old and raised protected against exposure to coccidia, were infected with a field isolate of 100,000 Eimeria spp. oocysts. This isolate was obtained from a farm with a previously calculated drug efficacy of 56% (95% confidence interval: -433.9 to 96.6%). At day 7 post-infection, 10 of the lambs were orally treated with 20 mg/kg toltrazuril (Baycox Sheep vet., Bayer Animal Health), while the other 10 lambs (controls) were given physiological saline.',\n",
       "  'Clinical examinations were conducted, and weight gains recorded. Daily faecal samples were scored for diarrhoea on a scale from 1 to 5, and oocyst excretion was determined using a modified McMaster technique. Oocysts were morphologically identified to species level. At 17–24 days post-infection, the lambs were euthanized and necropsied. RESULTS: The tested Eimeria isolate was resistant against toltrazuril, and resistance was seen in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. In addition, no significant differences in faecal score, growth, gross pathology or histological changes were identified between the two groups. The pathogenic E. ovinoidalis was the dominant species, and no significant difference in the individual prevalence of E. ovinoidalis post-treatment was found between treated (66.9%) and control lambs (61.9%). Other species identified included E. crandallis/weybridgensis, E. parva, E. marsica, E. faurei, E. pallida, E. ahsata and E. bakuensis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms toltrazuril resistance in ovine Eimeria spp.',\n",

Suggested strategies to control ruminant coccidiosis include pasture management, adequate nutrition, and hygienic measures [10, 11] . However, these measures are often difficult to implement in practice, and the main control approach is often metaphylaxis with anticoccidials     . Metaphylactic administration of a single oral dose of toltrazuril in the prepatent period has been shown to be effective at reducing clinical signs and maintaining adequate lamb growth rates in different production systems [13,      .

Field methods for assessment of drug efficacy, such as the FOCRT  and the faecal egg count reduction test used to evaluate anthelmintic efficacy  , give only an indication of reduced efficacy, and need verification through controlled efficacy trials (CET) [27, 28] .

Evaluation parameters included changes in: (i) villi, (ii) surface epithelium (atrophy/attenuation), (iii) degree of Eimeria-infection, (iv) hyperaemia, (v) oedema, (vi) infiltration of inflammatory cells and (vii) crypt abscesses, and were scored as follows: 0 = minimal; 1 = little; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe, including half-step grading. In addition, the presence of epithelial necrosis was graded as present (1) or absent (0).',\n",
       "  'A total histology score was calculated for each tissue by summation of all parameters evaluated (i-vii).Data were managed in Excel 2013 (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, USA), and subsequently analysed in R  and Stata 14 (Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. Stata-Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Evaluation of efficacy was performed according to the FOCRT  . For calculations of significance based on means, a t-test was used. P < 0.05 was considered significant.Mean growth rates were above 300 g/day until days 14-16, whereupon mean growth rate decreased to around 0 g/day (Fig. 1) . Growth rates increased again from day 21 onwards. The same pattern was observed in both treated and control lambs.From day 15, both treated and control lambs had a mean faecal score of ≥ 3, indicating diarrhoea. The maximum mean faecal score was seen at day 17 (3.9 ± 0.2) and day 18 (4.4 ± 0.3) in the treated and control groups, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Haemorrhagic diarrhoea was seen from day 14, in two treated and five control lambs, and tenesmus was observed in two control lambs (day 17).An increase in rectal temperature was seen from day 14, with maximum temperatures measured at day 18 (40.4 ± 0.4°C) and 16 (40.9 ± 0.4°C) in the treated and control groups, respectively. The mean duration of fever (> 40.5°C) was 2.3 ± 0.5 days and 1.9 ± 0.4 days for the treated and control groups, respectively. For these parameters, no significant difference between groups were seen at any time.At euthanasia, the mean hct was 39.2 ± 1.7% and 41.4 ± 1.9% in the treated and control groups, respectively. However, dehydration (hct > 45.0%) was only seen in 3 lambs, of which one had been treated with toltrazuril. Mean total serum protein decreased in both groups from infection to euthanasia, but no significant differences between the groups were observed.',\n",
       "  'Other biochemical parameters were within normal ranges (data not shown).Oocyst excretion was first recorded in one treated lamb at day 10 (10 OPG), followed by oocyst excretion in all lambs in both groups from day 14 onwards. Peak oocyst excretion was seen in the treated group at day 20 (mean OPG: 5,438,500), and in the control group at day 21 after infection (mean OPG: 3,630,850) (Fig. 2) . Thereafter, oocyst excretion decreased. There was no significant difference in oocyst excretion and species distribution between the groups at any time. All species present in the field isolate were isolated from the faecal samples of all the 20 infected lambs. E. ovinoidalis was the most prevalent species in both treated and control lambs (Table 1) .Efficacy, according to the FOCRT, was evaluated with confidence if the slope was ≥ 0.75, and with caution if slope was ≥ 0.5 and < 0.75  .',\n",
       "  'The slope ranged from 1.24 to 1.69 for the total oocyst excretion in the control lambs.Slopes, maximum likelihood estimates, and 95% CIs for the geometric mean efficacy of all oocysts, E. ovinoidalis, E. crandallis/weybridgensis, and the non-pathogenic Eimeria spp. are presented in Table 2 ; reduced efficacy of toltrazuril is apparent against both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. The slope was ≥ 0.75 for all time intervals and species, except for four of the five time intervals of E. crandallis/weybridgensis.Samples analysed for Cryptosporidium spp., Salmonella, coronavirus and rotavirus were all negative. Bacteriological analyses showed a mixed flora, dominated by coliforms and Enterococcus spp.Gross pathological findings included diffused thickened and folded ileal mucosa (7 treated and 7 controls), and fibrinous ileal content in two lambs (one treated and one control). Nodular or plaque-like foci in the ileal mucosa were seen in 4 treated and 6 control lambs (Fig. 3a ).',\n",
       "  'The regional distal jejunal lymph nodes were moderately increased in size and oedematous in 5 treated and 6 control lambs. Finally, watery abomasal content was seen in > 50 % of the animals in both groups.Microscopy evaluation showed lesions, mainly in the ileum, caecum and colon, with minor lesions in the jejunum (Fig. 3b-f ). However, there were no significant differences with respect to histological scores between the treated and control groups in any of the intestinal segments. The highest calculated histological score was found in the proximal ileum and at the base of caecum (Fig. 4) . The mean score for each parameter can be found in Additional file 2: Table S2 . Varying quantities of intracellular Eimeria stages were observed in all intestinal segments, except from jejunum, and they were mostly located in the villus epithelium, with fewer parasites in the crypt epithelium and lamina propria, and few in the submucosa and lymphatic vessels.',\n",
       "  'In both treated and control lambs, changes in the intestinal surfaces varied from light atrophy of the jejunal epithelium and blunting of affected ileal villi (Fig. 3b) , to areas of total flattening, attenuation of surface epithelium (Fig. 3e) and necrosis (Fig. 3d) . Patches of epithelial necrosis were found in all lambs. Infiltration of inflammatory cells included mostly monocytes and eosinophils, but also neutrophils and macrophages, and was found in both the lamina propria and submucosa. Different degrees of oedema, hyperaemia, and haemorrhage were seen in all tissue sections examined, and in both treated and control lambs. Crypt abscesses (Fig. 3b) were found in varying degree in all lambs, and contained inflammatory cells, debris and different stages of Eimeria spp.As far as we know, this is the first report of experimentally confirmed toltrazuril resistance in a field isolate of ovine Eimeria spp.',\n",
       "  'The results also support the use of FOCRT as a tool to evaluate ACE in the field. Although ten of the 20 lambs experimentally infected with Eimeria were metaphylactically treated with the recommended dose of 20 mg/kg toltrazuril (Baycox® Sheep vet., Bayer Animal Health), this treatment did not result in a significant reduction in oocyst excretion in the treated animals, compared with the controls. In addition, no significant differences were noted in clinical presentation, gross pathology, and histopathological findings. The speciation data showed that both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species of Eimeria in this isolate were resistant to toltrazuril. The lambs excreted high numbers of oocysts, as has previously been recorded in experimental infections with multiple Eimeria spp.  . Although oocyst excretion decreased from around day 20 after infection, the total duration of excretion could not be determined, as the lambs were euthanized.',\n",
       "  'The excretion pattern noted here, with an exponential increase, a plateau phase, and a decline, has previously been noted in experimental infections    . However, due to continuous reinfection under natural field conditions, the duration of oocyst excretion may be longer [38, 39] than observed in the present study. This might also explain why the calculated slope seen for all species in this experimental study is higher than the slopes reported from the preceding field trial  .Multi-species resistance, as observed here, has also been noted in field isolates of avian Eimeria spp. [3, 40] . Notes: The estimates were based on post-treatment oocyst counts for five time intervals between sample 1 (day 7 after infection) and sample 2, and was calculated according to the FOCRT  .',\n",
       "  'A slope ≥ 0.5 and < 0.75 was evaluated with caution, whereas a slope < 0.5 was interpreted as invalid a Four lambs were euthanized at day 17 Abbreviations: E. ovi, E. ovinoidalis; E. c/w, E. crandallis/weybridgensis; Non-pathogenic, all species except E. ovinoidalis and E. crandallis/weybridgensisOf particular importance in this study is that E. ovinoidalis was the dominant species excreted from infected lambs. As this species is one of the most pathogenic Eimeria spp. in sheep [41, 42] , resistance against the most commonly used anticoccidial drug indicates that severe clinical coccidiosis may be expected to occur in resistant flocks. Although E. ovinoidalis was the dominant species excreted, the most prevalent species in the original field-isolate inoculum was E. parva. This could reflect similarities between E. ovinoidalis and E. ninakholyakimovae in goats, the latter of which develops macroschizonts in endothelial cells, resulting in the release of thousands of merozoites [42, 43] .',\n",
       "  'Thus, the extent of intracellular multiplication/ replication, which is presumably also related to the extent of pathogenicity associated with this species, is higher for E. ovinoidalis than for the other Eimeria species.For E. crandallis/weybridgensis, the FOCRT calculations showed invalid results from three of the five sampling time points, probably due to the tests being performed too early in the infection. Excretion of E. crandallis/weybridgensis increased predominantly from day 16 onwards, and euthanasia was performed at days 17-24. Thus, the longer prepatent periods for these species compared with E. ovinoidalis  probably explain these results. This is an important finding, as the number of invalid farms tested in the FOCRT  might have been fewer should sample 2 have been collected 10-11 days after sample 1. These findings also highlight the fact that although Eimeria spp. are often considered as a relatively uniform group, they are in fact separate species with potentially important differences in biology and pathogenic potential.',\n",
       "  'Two of the lambs were treated with trimethoprim/ sulpha during their first days of life, preparations that have been shown to be effective in treating ovine coccidiosis [45, 46] . However, withdrawal periods for comparable drugs licenced in cattle are 10-15 days for meat  , and these lambs were treated > 17 days prior to the experimental infection. In addition, these treated lambs were in the control group, and therefore this treatment should not have affected the results of the study.Similar clinical signs as observed here might be caused by Cryptosporidium spp., coronavirus, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp., but none of these pathogens were detected. In addition, the findings of coliforms and Enterococcus spp. may be considered as normal intestinal flora of lambs  . The observed clinical signs were therefore almost certainly caused by Eimeria spp., particularly the two major pathogenic species, E. ovinoidalis and E. crandallis [35, 36] .',\n",
       "  'Thickened ileal mucosa is often seen in lambs infected with E. ovinoidalis  . In addition, the histological changes, such as blunted villi and surface necrosis, as well as the presence of coccidia, hyperaemia, oedema, infiltration of inflammatory cells and crypt abscesses, are also in accordance with previous reports [42, 50, 51] .To improve our study, an additional group of uninfected lambs might have been advantageous as this would have enabled better comparisons between weight gain and histopathological changes. However, this was not feasible at the time of the study. Furthermore, due to the lack of defined cut-off values for ACE, it might have been advantageous to include an oocyst isolate from a non-suspected farm (i.e. a susceptible isolate)  . This would have enabled comparisons of different parameters, such as oocyst excretion, between treated and control lambs infected with susceptible or resistant Eimeria spp.',\n",
       "  'However, due to lack of tools for selection of such susceptible ovine Eimeria isolates, we therefore chose to restrict our CET to treated and control lambs infected with isolate \"NMBU ID 35\" as a first step in the characterisation of anticoccidial resistance in ovine Eimeria spp.Although the initial efficacy values have not been provided for toltrazuril by the manufacturer, several studies have investigated its effect on oocyst excretion. For example, its efficacy has been found to be 96.9-99.9% in the period from 7 to 98 days after first treatment, in a study in which the lambs were treated every 14 days  . Other studies have shown toltrazuril efficacies [either provided in the publication or calculated as 1-(mean OPG treated group)/(mean OPG control group) from data in the publication] ranging from 90.0 to 100.0% in the period from two to three weeks after treatment [13, 18, 19,     .',\n",
       "  'These efficacies are far higher than that calculated in the present study, and therefore the comparative data provides a further clear indication of resistance in the \"NMBU ID 35\" isolate.Toltrazuril has been marketed for anticoccidial treatment in sheep since the 1980s, and its use has increased during recent years, both in Norway  and in the UK (Dr Gillian Diesel, personal communication). Extensive use of a drug over time may result in decreased efficacy, possibly due to the haploid stages of Eimeria, which immediately select for resistance [1, 5] . Since toltrazuril is the only registered anticoccidial for sheep in several countries, development of resistance in ovine Eimeria species may result in there being few treatment options available for sheep farmers, especially in northern Europe    . Diclazuril is an anticoccidial that has been registered for treatment of sheep in several countries, but as it may share a common mode of action to that of toltrazuril  , cross-resistance between these two triazine-derivates in ovine Eimeria spp.',\n",
       "  'seems highly likely and should be investigated. Indeed, cross-resistance between diclazuril and toltrazuril was reported for an isolate of avian Eimeria spp. over 20 years ago  .Our results indicate that there is a clear need for tools for evaluating ACE, such that inefficient treatments and, thus, the potential for reduced animal welfare and productivity can be avoided. Such tools are available for poultry, using different metrics, such as oocyst index, body weight gain, relative weight gain, lesion scores and anticoccidial index  . However, such methods have not yet been established for use in ruminants  , with Fig. 4 Box-and-whisker plots with outliers illustrating the histology score. The score was a summation of all histological parameters evaluated (see text) in the 20 Eimeria spp. infected lambs, red: toltrazuril treated, and blue: controls the exception of the newly published FOCRT  .',\n",
       "  'Although FOCRT may serve as a tool for field evaluation of ACE, there is a clear requirement for further testing of its use in different settings.Confirmation of the spectre of resistance in ovine Eimeria species increases the urgency of identifying alternative treatments and optimising other control strategies. The anticoccidial effects of different plants and natural extracts, such as sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), carob pods (Ceratonia siliqua), pomegranate (Punica granatum) peel extract, grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts, and different natural antioxidants, have been investigated in vivo and in vitro in different hosts      . However, none of these bioactive substances have, as yet, been brought to the market for the prevention of clinical coccidiosis. In addition, there are vaccines available for avian Eimeria spp. [65, 66] , and successful immunisation of goat kids with attenuated Eimeria spp. oocysts has been performed  .Future studies are necessary in order to develop a commercial vaccine against ovine Eimeria spp.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, current efforts should focus on identifying ACE, and maintaining the efficacy of toltrazuril in susceptible flocks. Management strategies that decrease the need for anticoccidials by reducing the infection pressure, possibly achieved by applying strict hygienic measures, and improved flock and pasture management should be actively encouraged by veterinarians and agricultural policy incentives  . Additionally, farmers should be informed about the importance of correct drenching techniques, including dosage estimation and drench gun calibration, as these have been shown to be inadequate in several farms  .To our knowledge, this is the first report of ACR against toltrazuril in an ovine Eimeria field isolate, which included the highly pathogenic species, E. ovinoidalis. The results also support the use of FOCRT for field evaluation of ACE. However, the distribution and prevalence of ACR is unknown and further studies are warranted.',\n",

METHODS: This retrospective observation study is comprised of seven patients who presented with MEWDS in a 3-month period in central Israel.

Three reported a precedent viral infection. All had unilateral decreased vision. Funduscopy revealed foveal granularity. MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS: Hyperfluorescent spots on blue autofluorescence (BAF), hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green angiography, dark lesions on infrared photos, and ellipsoid zone irregularities on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Resolution of the spots on BAF correlated with anatomic (SD-OCT) and visual recovery. OCT angiography performed following the convalescence stage demonstrated intact retinal and choroidal flow. Serologic findings were inconclusive.\",\n",
       "  'CONCLUSION: We report a unique cluster of MEWDS patients presented in a short period of time. SD-OCT findings of ellipsoid zone disruption in combination with other multimodal imaging modalities are outlined meticulously. Recognizing these imaging features along with high index of clinical suspicion is important for the diagnosis of MEWDS. Serologic testing might be considered in future patients.Text: Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) was first described in 1984 as a rare, sudden onset of unilateral chorioretinopathy, with the predominant sign being multifocal yellow-white spots throughout the retina [1, 2] . The clinical spectrum of MEWDS has expanded over the years to include bilaterality and recurrences  or an atypical presentation involving the fovea without the white spots  . Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity unilaterally accompanied in most cases by photopsia and scotomata. A prodromal flu-like illness has been reported in up to 50% of cases  .',\n",
       "  \"One report described a patient with elevated levels of total serum IgG during the disease course and negative findings for IgM to herpes zoster, herpes simplex, mumps, and measles  .Although MEWDS is suspected to occur as a consequence of a viral-like infection in genetically susceptible individuals, its precise pathogenesis remains unknown. Recovery is gradual, over weeks to months, and the visual prognosis is very favorable  . Treatment is usually not required.The incidence of MEWDS is unknown. Only small case series are reported in the literature          . One of the largest described 34 affected patients reviewed over several years' period [1, 13, 14] .The aim of the present report was to describe an unusual cluster of seven cases of MEWDS encountered within a 3month period, with an emphasis on the clinical presentation and multimodal imaging findings.\",\n",
       "  'The cluster prompted us to seek a common infectious association.A retrospective observational study was conducted in seven patients who presented with MEWDS between July and September 2013 at two tertiary medical centers in central Israel. Data on background, clinical, and laboratory parameters were collected from the medical files. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board.All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination and multimodal imaging tests, including blue autofluorescence (BAF), fluorescein angiography (FA) and/ or indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), infrared (IR) photography, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Images were acquired with the HRA-2 and the Spectralis HRA + OCT devices (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) at the following wavelengths: BAFexcitation 488 nm, barrier cut-off 496 nm; IR-820 nm; ICGA-excitation 790 nm, emission 800 nm; and SD-OCTsuperluminescent diode light source 870 nm. The volume scan option was used to acquire the multiple SD-OCT scans (25-49 horizontal scans over a 6 mm region covering the area of pathology).',\n",
       "  'Precise registration between findings seen on IR or BAF and SD-OCT was enabled by the dual-beam laser eye-tracking system, where one laser is used to image the retina and the other laser to perform the OCT scans. Accurate rescanning in areas of interest was ensured by the Spectralis follow-up function which automatically places subsequent scans on the same location as the previous ones.OCT angiography images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue (Optovue Inc., Fremont, California, USA), with an A-scan-rate of 70 000 scans per second, a light source of 840 nm, and a bandwidth of 45 nm. Macular cubes (3 × 3 mm) were acquired, each cube consisting of 304 clusters of 2 repeated B-scans containing 304 A-scans each. Split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation technology was employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by splitting the spectrum to generate multiple repeat OCT frames from 2 original repeat OCT frames  .Motion correction was performed using registration of 2 orthogonally captured imaging volumes.',\n",
       "  \"Automatic segmentation of the retinal layers was performed by the viewing software and was used to generate en face projection images after adjusting the level of the segmented layer on the B-scans.Serology testing was performed for viruses commonly present at the time of the patients' presentation, namely, immunoglobulin IgG and IgM for herpes simplex virus (HSV) I-II, varicella zoster virus (VZV), West Nile virus, coxsackievirus, echovirus (subgroup of enterovirus), and corona virus.Findings. There were one male and six female patients of mean age 31.5 ± 7.2 years (range 22-41 years). Table 1 summarizes the demographic data. Three patients reported a prodromal virus infection.All patients presented with acute onset of unilateral decreased vision. The best corrected visual acuity at presentation ranged from 6/9 to 6/30 in the affected eye. None of the patients had signs of anterior or vitreous inflammation in the affected eye.\",\n",
       "  'Funduscopic findings at presentation included foveal granularity in six patients; in four patients (patients 1, 4, 5, and 6), it was the sole pathologic retinal finding ( Figure 1 ); and in three patients (patients 2, 3, and 7), foveal granularity was associated with faint white retinal lesions (Figure 2 ), located mainly in the midperipheral retina extending to the periphery. Patient 6 had a swollen disc and mild signs of optic neuropathy (mild red desaturation, enlarged blind spot on visual field). Patient 6 underwent neurological evaluation due to initial presentation mimicking optic neuritis. Neurological evaluation including full neurological exam and neuroimaging excluded additional neurological deficit, before the diagnosis of MEWDS was established. The clinical findings are summarized in Table 2. 3.2. Multimodal Imaging Findings. Patients who underwent imaging less than 2 weeks from onset of symptoms had the most typical findings.BAF revealed hyperautofluorescent lesions in the macula between and along the arcades in four patients (patients 1, 3, 6, and 7).',\n",
       "  \"IR photos showed dark lesions in similar, though not identical, locations ( Figure 3 ). Patients 1 and 6, who underwent ICGA, had hypofluorescent lesions in numbers typically exceeding those detected by both clinical and other imaging modalities. B-scan SD-OCT through the fovea showed a disrupted inner segment ellipsoid zone band of varied severity in all 7 affected eyes. The ellipsoid zone hyper reflective band on SD-OCT anatomically correlates to photoreceptors' inner segment, ellipsoid section densely packed with mitochondria  . The transient disruption of the foveal ellipsoid zone on SD-OCT corresponded to the clinically apparent foveal granularity. In patient 5, who presented with sole retinal finding of foveal granularity and mild optic disc leakage on FA, the SD-OCT finding of ellipsoid zone disruption was the main sign for diagnosis MEWDS (Figure 1 ). Foveal hyperreflectivity found in 3 patients (patients 1, 4, and 7) was noted extending into the inner retinal layers (Figure 4 ).\",\n",
       "  'The lesions identified on the BAF, IR, and ICGA images corresponded to the areas of disruption of the ellipsoid zone, on the SD-OCT scans ( Figure 3 ). FA demonstrated nonspecific early punctate hyperfluorescent lesions, with slight staining during the early phase, in four patients (patients 2, 3, 6, and 7). These lesions did not correspond to the findings by either the clinical or other imaging modalities. No pathology was noted in the foveal area despite the presence of typical foveal granularity. Mild optic disc leakage was evident in four patients (patients 1, 4, 5, and 6).During the course of the disease, the hyperautofluorescent areas decreased in number and faded without leaving hypoautofluorescent abnormalities. The resolution of the BAF lesions corresponded to the anatomic recovery observed on SD-OCT. The foveal hyperreflectivity disappeared as well ( Figure 5 ).',\n",
       "  'Figure 6 .Four patients (patients 1, 4, 6, and 7) underwent serological testing with negative results except for a common result of elevated titer of IgG to VZV.After 6 months of follow-up, the best corrected visual acuity ranged from 6/6 to 6/6.6 ( Table 2 ).Although MEDWS is traditionally considered as a rare syndrome  , we report an unusual cluster of seven patients who presented within a three-month period. All patients were otherwise healthy, and all presented with decreased vision in one eye. This cluster of cases could break to some measure the statistical improbability of the rarity of the disease. The atypical presentation in most of our patients could suggest that MEWDS is underdiagnosed. However, it may be in line with the speculation that sometimes atypical findings may simply reflect the moment in time in which the patients were examined and are not a true atypical presentation  .',\n",
       "  'In its original description by Jampol et al. , MEWDS cases were unilateral with fundus presentation including numerous white dots scattered in the posterior pole and beyond the arcades. During the disease course, granularity appearance of the macula develops in most cases and, when seen, determines the diagnosis. The number of white spots is very variable, and in fact, they may be absent. Given that characteristic white dots were not present in four patients (patients 1, 4, 5, and 6), we were guided by other fundus features, in particular foveal granularity, symptoms, multimodal imaging, and clinical course. While the presumed pathogenesis of MEWDS involves a viral infection, only few reports to date have described a search for the pathogen [5,    . The present cluster of cases provided us with a unique opportunity to seek a common viral denominator.',\n",
       "  'Serological testing yielded only an elevated titer of IgG to VZV, most often an indicative of past VZV infection or vaccination; thus, we could not make any generalization regarding these findings.Multimodal imaging (BAF, SD-OCT, IR, FA, and ICGA) has proven to have high value in the challenging diagnosis of MEWDS. Most of the findings noted here have been described separately in earlier reports [7-9, 11, 12] . However, the present study offered two important advantages. We were able to examine all patients with simultaneously acquired imaging, and multiple correlations between the imaging findings and the clinical evaluation were possible. Moreover, the relatively large size of the cohort and the repeated scans allowed us to verify the imaging findings in this rare disease.We observed corresponding locations of the dark spots on IR images, the hyperautofluorescent spots on the BAF images, and the foci of outer retinal pathology on SD-OCT images.',\n",
       "  'Small hyperreflective points, located in the ganglion cell layer, the ellipsoid zone, and the choriocapillaris, have been noted and described on \"en face\" EDI SD-OCT  . However, we noted a unique finding of foveal hyperreflectivity extending into the inner retinal layers. Our finding reinforces a recently described finding in the literature  which is believed to be pathognomonic to MEWDS. During the disease course, both the IR and the BAF findings faded in concurrence with the anatomical resolution of the disruption in the ellipsoid zone and the foveal hyperreflective lesion on SD-OCT. Thus, IR images may provide an easy, widely available imaging modality for follow-up of patients with MEWDS. Although IR autofluorescent changes were recently described in patients with MEWDS [21, 22] , this modality is not widely available, whereas IR imaging is routinely performed.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, on the basis of our findings with multimodal imaging, we suggest that the diagnosis of MEWDS can be established with the simultaneous use of such noninvasive techniques as BAF, IR, and SD-OCT. ICGA and FA may be reserved for secondary use, when findings are equivocal. OCTA is relatively new noninvasive imaging modality that demonstrates flow characteristics of the vascular network within the regional circulation to construct noninvasive images of the vascular network. En face images generated by OCTA also allow us to study the spatial relationships between vasculature and adjacent retinal/choroidal layers with greater precision than dye angiography, and OCTA findings demonstrated no flow impairment in the retinal and choroidal vasculature of the patients scanned after convalescence stage.We cannot overestimate the role of multimodal imaging in these patients, since not too often, the diagnosis is mistaken for optic neuritis, and clinical findings are very subtle.Limitations of the study were the variability in time from disease onset to serologic testing, making the IgM results hard to interpret.',\n",
       "  \"Therefore, we consider these tests inconclusive. Secondly, not all the patients had imaging with all modalities. In addition, future research is required using OCT angiography to study the nature of the dots in MEWDS patients and its correlation to other multimodal imaging modalities in the acute and convalescent stage.In conclusion, we present a large unique cluster of patients who presented with MEWDS over a short period Figure 6 : OCTA images following convalescence stage of patients 7's right eye (a-b) and 6's left eye (c-d).

       "  'Attention should also be addressed to the dark spots demonstrated on IR images, which may serve as an additional diagnostic clue provided by a noninvasive imaging modality. The disease course in our patients was typical for MEWDS, with almost complete recovery of visual acuity. The specific pathogenesis of MEWDS is unknown but is believed to be an inflammatory condition following a viral infection. We suggest continued serological testing in patients who meet the clinical criteria. The clinical signs of MEWDS are subtle, such that the diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion.The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.'],\n",
       " ['OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p < 0.001).',\n",
       "  'Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3%, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community. This pilot study provides evidence that data from the community can potentially represent different information than that sourced clinically, suggesting the need for community surveillance to enhance public health efforts and scientific understanding of respiratory infections.Text: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) (the cause of both upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs)) are a major cause of death among children under 5 years old particularly in developing countries where the burden of disease is 2-5 times higher than in developed countries  . While these viruses usually cause mild cold-like symptoms and can be self-limiting, in recent years novel coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have evolved and infected humans, causing severe illness, epidemics and pandemics  .',\n",
       "  'Currently, the majority of all infectious disease outbreaks as recorded by the World Health Organization (WHO) occur in the continent of Africa where there is high transmission risk [3, 4] . Further, in developing areas (both rural and urban), there are increasing risk factors such as human-animal interfaces (due to residential-proximity to livestock). These changing epidemiological patterns have resulted in calls for improved ARI surveillance, especially in places of high transmission risk  .Nigeria is one such place with high prevalence of many of the risk factors implicated in ARI among children including; age, sex, overcrowding, nutritional status, socio-economic status, and where study of ARIs is currently limited  . These broad risk factors alongside limited resources have indicated the need for community-based initiatives for surveillance and interventions [6, 7] . For ARI surveillance in particular, infections in the community are those that do not get reported clinically.',\n",
       "  'Clinical data generally represents the most severe cases, and those from locations with access to healthcare institutions. In Nigeria, hospitals are visited only when symptoms are very severe. Thus, it is hypothesized that viral information from clinical sampling is insufficient to either capture disease incidence in general populations or its predictability from symptoms  . Efforts worldwide including in East and Southern Africa have been focused on developing community-based participatory disease surveillance methods      . Community-based approaches have been shown useful for learning more about emerging respiratory infections such as assessing under-reporting  , types of viruses prevalent in communities  , and prediction of epidemics  .Concurrently, advancements in molecular identification methods have enabled studies regarding the emergence and epidemiology of ARI viruses in many locations (e.g. novel polyomaviruses in Australia [16, 17] , human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (HCoV-EMC) in the Middle East and United Kingdom [18, 19] , SARS in Canada and China    ), yet research regarding the molecular epidemiology of ARI viruses in Nigeria is limited.',\n",
       "  \"Diagnostic methods available and other constraints have limited studies there to serological surveys of only a few of these viruses and only in clinical populations [23, 24] . Thus, the utility of community-based surveillance may be appropriate in contexts such as in Nigeria, and the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate if clinical cases may describe the entire picture of ARI among children in Nigeria.We performed a cross-sectional study in three community centers and one clinical in Ilorin, Nigeria. Ilorin is in Kwara state and is the 6th largest city in Nigeria by population  . Three Local Government Areas (Ilorin East, Ilorin South and Ilorin West LGAs) were the community sites and Children's Specialist Hospital, Ilorin the clinical site. Convenience sampling was used for the purposes of this pilot study, and samples were obtained from March 28 to April 5 2017.\",\n",

Exclusion criteria were: children who were 14 and above, not showing signs of ARI and subjects whose parents did not give consent. Twenty-five children with symptoms were selected each from the three community locations while 16 symptomatic children were sampled from the hospital. The total sample size (n = 91) was arrived at based on materials and processing cost constraints, as well as to provide enough samples to enable descriptive understanding of viral circulation patterns estimated from other community-based studies  .Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers, who are employed by the State Ministry of Health and familiar with the communities in this study, performed specimen and data collection. Symptoms considered were derived in accordance with other ARI surveillance efforts: sore throat, fever, couch, running nose, vomiting, body ache, leg pain, nausea, chills, shortness of breath [10, 26] .',\n",
       "  'Gender and age, type of residential area (rural/urban), education level, proximity of residence to livestock, proximity to an untarred road and number of people who sleep in same room, were all recorded. The general difference between the two settings was that those from the hospital had severe illnesses, while those from the community were generally \"healthy\" but exhibiting ARI symptoms (i.e. mild illness).Nasal swabs were collected from the subjects and stored in DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, California). Collected samples were spinned and the swab removed. Residues containing the nasal samples were stored at -20 °C prior to molecular analysis.Viral RNA was isolated using ZR Viral RNA ™ Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California) per manufacturer instructions (http://www.zymoresearch.com/downloads/dl/file/ id/147/r1034i.pdf ).',\n",

Standardized procedures were used for community and clinic sampling.All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.4.

A p value < 0.001 was considered significant. No observations used in this study had any missing data for analyses in this study.Basic participant demographics are summarized in PCR results showed that ten different viruses (influenza A, coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63, RSVA, RSV B, parainfluenza 1-4) were detected. Figure 1 shows how these infections were distributed across virus types as well as in the community versus clinic samples. In sum, a total of 33 of the 91 subjects surveyed had one or more respiratory tract virus (36.3%, 95% CI 26.6-47.0%, Fig. 1 ).',\n",

Figure 2 indicates how frequently each pair of viruses were found in the same participant; co-infections were most common among enterovirus and parainfluenza virus 4 (Fig. 2) .We also compared and contrasted the clinical and community results. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses found in the clinical sample. These three infections resulted in 41 viruses detected in 15 subjects clinically, and eight infections detected in five people in the community. Together they infected 94% (15/16, 95% CI 67.7-99.7%) of clinical subjects, and 7% (5/75, 95% CI 2.5-15.5%) in the community (significant difference, p < 0.001). The most common virus detected in community samples was Coronavirus OC43; this virus was detected in 13.3% (95% CI 6.9-23.6%) people in the community and not in any of the clinical samples.',\n",
       "  \"However a different strain, coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected in 12.5% of the clinical subjects (2/16, 95% CI 2.2-39.6%) and not detected in the community. Double, triple and quadruple infections were another common feature of note.We identified ten different respiratory tract viruses among the subjects as shown in Fig. 1 . Samples collected from the Children's specialist hospital showed 100% prevalence rate of infection with one or more viruses. This might not be surprising, as the basic difference between the community and clinic samples was an increased severity of illness in the clinical sample. This may also explain the high level of co-infection found among the clinical subjects. The most prevalent virus in the clinical sample (coronavirus OC43) was not detected in the community sample. Further, there was a significant difference between prevalence of the most common viruses in the clinical sample (parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus) and their prevalence in the community.\",\n",
       "  'Finally, some of the viruses detected in this study have not been detected and implicated with ARIs in Nigeria. There is no report, to the best of our knowledge, implicating coronavirus in ARIs in Nigeria, and it was detected in 12 subjects in this study. Although cases of double and triple infections were observed in a study in Nigeria in 2011  , as far as we are aware, reports of quadruple infections are rare and have not been reported in Nigeria previously.Due to the unique nature of the data generated in this study and novelty of work in the setting, it is not possible to exactly compare results to other studies. For example, though we found a similar study regarding ARIs in clinical subjects in Burkina Faso  , due to the small sample size from this study it would not be feasible to infer or compare prevalence rates.',\n",
       "  'Studies of ARI etiology have mostly been generally focused in areas of the world that are more developed  , and it is important to note that the availability of molecular diagnostic methods as employed in this study substantially improve the ability to detect viruses which hitherto have not been detected in Nigeria. Further, findings from this work also add to the growing body of research that shows value of community-data in infectious disease surveillance  . As most of the work to-date has been in higher resource areas of the world this study adds perspective from an area where healthcare resources are lower.In conclusion, results of this study provide evidence for active community surveillance to enhance public health surveillance and scientific understanding of ARIs. This is not only because a minority of children with severe infection are admitted to the hospital in areas such this in Nigeria, but also findings from this pilot study which indicate that viral circulation in the community may not get detected clinically  .',\n",
       "  'This pilot study indicates that in areas of Nigeria, etiology of ARIs ascertained from clinical samples may not represent all of the ARIs circulating in the community.The main limitation of the study is the sample size. In particular, the sample is not equally representative across all ages. However, the sample size was big enough to ascertain significant differences in community and clinic sourced viruses, and provides a qualitative understanding of viral etiology in samples from the community and clinic. Moreover, the sample was largely concentrated on subjects under 6 years, who are amongst the groups at highest risk of ARIs. Despite the small sample size, samples here indicate that circulation patterns in the community may differ from those in the clinic. In addition, this study resulted in unique findings Given that resources are limited for research and practice, we hope these pilot results may motivate further systematic investigations into how community-generated data can best be used in ARI surveillance.',\n",
       "  'Results of this study can inform a larger study, representative across demographic and locations to systematically assess the etiology of infection and differences in clinical and community cohorts. A larger study will also enable accounting for potential confounders such as environmental risk factors. Finally, while it may be intuitive, findings from this pilot study shed light on the scope of differences in ARI patterns including different types and strains of circulating viruses. Also, because PCR was used for viral detection, the study was limited to detection of viruses in the primer sets. Given that these are the most up-to-date and common viruses, this approach was deemed sufficient for this initial investigation. The study was conceived by RC and OK. RC and OK, MO and TD were involved in the design of the study, which was conducted by MO and TD. RC and OK analyzed the data.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to assess the spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens in children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infections in Cyprus. For this purpose nasopharyngeal swab samples from 424 children less than 12 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections were collected over three epidemic seasons and were analysed for the presence of the most common 15 respiratory viruses. A viral pathogen was identified in 86% of the samples, with multiple infections being observed in almost 20% of the samples. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (30.4%) and Rhinovirus (27.4%). RSV exhibited a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year.',\n",

The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections.Text: Viral Respiratory tract infections (RTI) represent a major public health problem because of their world-wide occurrence, ease of transmission and considerable morbidity and mortality effecting people of all ages. Children are on average infected two to three times more frequently than adults, with acute RTIs being the most common infection in childhood [1, 2] . Illnesses caused by respiratory viruses include, among others, common colds, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and otitis media.',\n",
       "  'Rapid diagnosis is important not only for timely therapeutic intervention but also for the identification of a beginning influenza epidemic and the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatment [3, 4] .RTIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute RTI is most common in children under five years of age, and represents 30-50% of the paediatric medical admissions, as well as 20-40% of hospitalizations in children. Respiratory infections cluster during winter and early spring months. The leading viral agents include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B (INF-A, INF-B) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human adenoviruses (HAdVs). In addition, there is a continuously increasing list of new respiratory viruses that contribute significantly to the burden of acute respiratory infections, such as the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human Bocavirus (HBoV)  .Acute RTIs are classified as upper (UTRIs) and lower RTI (LRTIs), according to the involved anatomic localization.',\n",
       "  'URTIs cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for continuous circulation of pathogens in the community. LRTIs have been classified as frank pneumonia and bronchiolitis with clinical, radiological and etiological features that usually overlap [6, 7] . Viruses are again the foremost agents of LRTIs often misdiagnosed as bacterial in origin and hence treated with antibiotics unnecessarily  .The main aim of this study was to determine the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and assess the epidemiology of the identified viral pathogens over three epidemic seasons.The study was approved by the Cyprus National Bioethics Committee. Accordingly, written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to sample taking. Between November 2010 and October 2013, 485 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children up to 12 years of age, who had been hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at the Archbishop Makarios III hospital, Nicosia.',\n",

       "  'For this purpose, all available complete genome sequences were obtained for each virus from GenBank, imported into the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v7.1.7 and aligned using ClustalX. In case of mismatches between published primers/probe and target sequences, modifications were applied, as indicated in Table 1 . The alignments for the viruses, which necessitated changes to the primers/probe are available in Fasta-Format as supplement S1-S4 Files.Primer concentrations and reaction conditions for the four assays were subsequently optimised for multiplexing. In order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, the laboratory enrolled for two consecutive years in Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) external quality assessment schemes for all viruses, except Bocavirus, which was unavailable. In summary, the established assays were able to correctly identify all viruses tested, proving their suitability for diagnostic application.A possible correlation of virus prevalence and age of infection was assessed using univariate analyses.',\n",

The same statistical tests were used to compare the frequency of subjects with single or multiple infections between age groups. In addition, Pearson correlation was used to examine co-infections of different viruses. All statistical analyses were performed using StataSE 12 (StatCorp. 2007. College Station, TX, USA).The present study was a prospective investigation of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2013 in Cyprus.

A low frequency was exhibited by HMPV with 16 (3.8%) positive samples, human coronavirus OC43 with 13 (3.1%), PIV 1 with 12 (2.8%), PIV 4 with 9 (2.1%), PIV 2 with 7 (1.7%) and HCoV NL63 with 6 (1.4%). Coronavirus 229E could be detected only in a single sample.Co-infections with two or more viruses were observed in 84 out of the 364 positive samples (see Table 2 ). Dual infections accounted for 17% of all positive samples and three viruses were detected in 2.7% of samples). A single patient sample displayed a quadruple infection being simultaneously positive for RSV, rhinovirus, HBoV and influenza B.',\n",
       "  'Table 3 summarizes the frequency of each virus in single vs. multiple infections as well as the number of co-occurrences of viruses for each possible virus combination. In absolute terms the most common combination observed was RSV/rhinovirus. As a percentage, however, the virus appearing most often in co- infections was HBoV, which was found in more than 70% of cases together with another virus, followed by coronaviruses HCoV OC43 and HCoV NL63 with 61% and 67%, respectively. On the other hand, the viruses most rarely seen in co-infections were influenza viruses A and B as well as RSV. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the likelihood of co-infections of different viruses. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 1 in S1 Table. Significant correlation (P-value < 0.05) was seen mostly for co-infections with RSV, however correlations were very weak (r<0.3) and negative.',\n",
       "  'This finding can probably be explained by the fact that RSV infections occurred predominantly in the very young, where co-infections were less frequently observed. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was observed for enterovirus and rhinovirus co-infection hinting maybe at similarities in circulation patterns and/or transmission modes.Regarding seasonality, different patterns of circulations could be observed for RSV, rhinoviruses and influenzaviruses (A and B combined) (Fig 2) , with RSV and influenza exhibiting a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. However, as more than 100 different rhinovirus strains have been identified to be circulating worldwide in parallel and successively, a potential seasonality of individual rhinovirus serotypes may be masked by overlapping patterns [18, 19] .The data was further analysed with regard to the age distribution of virus infection (see Table 2 ).',\n",
       "  'In infants up to 3 months old, RSV was by far the most common pathogen (58.1%), followed by rhinovirus (20.3%) and PIV3 with 8.1% each. The incidence of RSV, however, decreases significantly with increasing age (p-value < 0.0001) dropping to 13% in children older than 3 years old, while the reverse relationship is observed for Influenza A and B and HAdV. Rhinoviruses, HBoV and enteroviruses are most frequently observed in children from 4 months to 3 years of age. The age dependency of the virus incidence is visualized in Fig 3 for the seven most frequently observed viruses. The positivity rate also showed a trend according to the age group dropping from 90.5% in the under 3-month old to 78.3% in the 4-12 years old (p-value = 0.020).',\n",
       "  'This may point to an increasing role of pathogens not included in the assays, such as bacterial infections in older children.Regarding multiple infections, children less than 3 month of age and those older than 4 years had a significantly smaller risk to present with multiple infections as compared to the other two age groups (p-value = 0.014).A reason for this could be that very young children have limited contact to others reducing thereby the chance for a co-infection, whereas children older than 3 years already established immunity to an increasing number of viruses encountered previously.This study for the first time examined the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children in Cyprus. Four multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR assays were developed in order to detect the most common respiratory viral pathogens in a fast and cost-effective way.',\n",
       "  'The high rate of positive samples (85.8%) is evidence of the high sensitivity of the Multiplex-assays used and that the range of viruses included in the analysis is comprehensive. Many previous studies have shown detection rates ranging from below 50% to 75%      .The most common viruses detected were RSV and rhinovirus accounting for almost 60% of all cases. Both viruses were reported previously by others as the major aetiology for respiratory viral infections in young children with rhinoviruses being recognized increasingly for their role in lower respiratory tract infections [20,       .Our data support the results of similar studies performed in the Middle East region. A recently published study found that RSV was the most commonly detected virus in nasopharyngeal swabs from children presenting symptoms of RTIs and in addition to that it also showed that RSV infections follow a similar circulation pattern peaking from December to March  .',\n",
       "  'Another study has revealed that RSV and PIV3 incidence decreases significantly with age, whereas the opposite is observed for influenza and adenovirus infections, a trend that was also observed in our study  .Mixed infections were observed in approximately 20% of all samples, which is in the middle of previously reported rates ranging from 10 to almost 40%. HBoV, HCoV and EV were found most frequently in co-infections. All three subtypes of HCoV were co-detected with several other viruses, while HBoV was co-detected mainly with HRV and RSV. In the case of EV infections, EV were almost predominantly associated with HRV. The rare presence of InfA and InfB viruses in multiple infections witnessed in our study was also observed elsewhere [32, 33] .',\n",
       "  'Even though this study did not allow for investigating a possible association between multiple infections and disease severity, a review of the literature shows that such a potential association is still subject to controversy, since there are reports showing no relationship of multiple virus infection with respiratoty illness severity on one hand or a significant association on the other. Studies have shown that viral co-infection was significantly associated with longer duration of illness symptoms, but with a decreased severity in hospitalized children regarding oxygen requirement and intensive care unit admission, whereas the findings of other studies have indicated that severe clinical phenotypes were more prevalent in co-infection patients, especially in RSV co-infections that may increase the severity of RSV associated disease in children [25,        .Viral respiratory infections continue to be a worldwide health concern.',\n",
       "  'As the clinical symptoms of patients with acute respiratory tract infections do usually not allow a discrimination of viral or bacterial aetiology, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are required for better antibiotic stewardship and the implementation of appropriate infection control measures [4, 41] . The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections.'],\n",

A total of 424 clinical samples were examined from equids with enteric disease in 24 Irish counties between 2011 and 2015. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect ECoV RNA. Nucleocapsid, spike and the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes of positive samples were sequenced, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Five samples (1.2%) collected in 2011 and 2013 tested positive for ECoV. Positive samples were collected from adult horses, Thoroughbred foals and a donkey foal. Sequence and/or phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleocapsid, spike and p12.7 genes were highly conserved and were closely related to ECoVs identified in other countries. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions.',\n",

The clinical signs associated with ECoV infection during outbreaks in the USA  and Japan    were fever, anorexia, lethargy and diarrhoea. The same clinical signs were also recorded in an experimental challenge study using Japanese draft horses  . The main transmission route is considered to be faecal-oral  and ECoV is usually detected in faecal samples. However, the molecular detection of ECoV in faeces from horses with diarrhoea, does not prove causation.',\n",

ECoV was detected in samples collected from equids in 48 states of the USA  . In central Kentucky, approximately 30% of both healthy and diarrheic Thoroughbred foals were infected with ECoV  . All of the qPCR positive foals with diarrhoea were co-infected with other pathogens such as rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens, suggesting that there was potential for ECoV to be over-diagnosed as a causative agent in complex diseases. In contrast in Japan, although an outbreak of diarrhoea occurred among ECoV-infected draft horses at one racecourse    , there have been no similar outbreaks subsequently, and all rectal swabs collected from diarrheic Thoroughbred foals were negative.',\n",

Similar to the reports from Japan and France, a low prevalence of ECoV was also observed in the UK  , Saudi Arabia and Oman  . The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of ECoV in clinical samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ireland. The samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as it has been shown to be the most sensitive diagnostic method for ECoV  and is routinely employed as an alternative to virus isolation in diagnostic laboratories worldwide, both for timely diagnosis and in epidemiological studies [9, 10] .',\n",

To prove that the extraction was successful and that there was no inhibition during rRT-PCR amplification, an internal positive control primer/probe (PrimerDesign, Southampton, UK) was added to the master mix. Thermal cycling conditions were; 48 • C for 10 min and 95 • C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 • C for 15 s and 60 • C for 45 s.

However, detection of ECoV in faeces samples from horses with enteric disease does not prove causation. In this study, 424 samples collected between 2011 and 2015 from equids with enteric disease were tested, and only five samples (1.2%) were positive for ECoV. The inclusion of an internal positive control in the rRT-PCR eliminated the possibility of false negative results due to the presence of PCR inhibitors but the high content of nucleases associated with faeces samples may have caused some RNA degradation.',\n",
       "  'However, this low prevalence of ECoV is similar to that identified in France  and among Thoroughbred foals in Japan  .Although ECoV has been identified on three continents, little is known about the genetic and pathogenic diversity in field viruses. In this study, sequence and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1 ) demonstrated a high level of homology between viruses detected in a donkey and a horse in two provinces in Ireland in different years. This suggests that Irish ECoVs may have low genetic diversity. Compared with the ECoVs of other countries, the N, S and p12.7 genes of the two Irish viruses were highly conserved. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions ( Figure S1 ).

Higher case numbers are identified in the USA during the colder months (October to April)  , and our results were consistent with the circulation period in USA. It has been reported that outbreaks mainly occurred among adult riding, racing and show horses in USA  . The choice of cases to include in the current study may not have been optimal for detection of ECoV as the majority of samples were from foals. However, two positive samples were collected from adult horses in a combined riding school/show jumping yard in the West of Ireland.',\n",

Cold weather may have been a predisposing factor to the ECoV infection on the farm.Two positive samples were collected from Thoroughbred foals. A faeces sample collected from one foal with severe watery diarrhoea and inappetance was positive for ECoV but a sample collected three days later tested negative. A potential difficulty in detecting ECoV from naturally infected horses has been noted previously as serial samples from seven sick horses in the USA suggested that ECoV only persisted for three to nine days in faeces  . In both cases, the diarrhoea may have been caused by other unidentified coinfecting pathogens as has been suggested by investigators in the USA  .

There are over 50 Thoroughbred horses per 10,000 of population in Ireland, compared to between three and five for Great Britain, France and the USA  . Thus, an investigation of ECoV in Ireland is pertinent not only to increase awareness nationally of the epidemiology of the virus and promote discussion on its clinical importance, but also to inform the industry globally of the health status of Irish horses. Ireland exports horses all over the world.',\n",

The outbreak at a draft-horse racetrack in Japan in 2009 affected 132 of approximately 600 horses and resulted in non-starters and the implementation of movement restrictions  . However, draft horses appear to have a higher infection rate than other breeds and an outbreak of similar severity has not been reported in Thoroughbred racehorses [10, 20] . The much higher incidence of ECoV positive Thoroughbred foals identified in Kentucky compared to similar populations internationally suggests an increased susceptibility to ECoV infection in that population. In the past, specific environmental factors were associated with extensive reproductive loss in the Kentucky area and to a lesser extent in other states  , but predisposing regional factors such as differences in management, environment or husbandry have not been identified for ECoV.',\n",

There was no indication from the results of this study that coronavirus is a major cause of diarrhoea in Irish horses but the introduction of rRT-PCR as a routine diagnostic test will assist in elucidating the significance of this virus to the Irish breeding, racing and sports industries. The primary focus in future will be on testing adult horses that present with anorexia, lethargy, fever and changes in faecal character as a significant association has been demonstrated between this clinical status and molecular detection of ECoV in faeces  .'],\n",
       " ['BACKGROUND: Pertussis is estimated to cause 2 percent of childhood deaths globally and is a growing public health problem in developed countries despite high vaccination coverage. Infants are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy may be effective to prevent pertussis in young infants, but population-based estimates of disease burden in infants are lacking, particularly in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. METHODS: Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014.',\n",

CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based active home surveillance for respiratory illness, a low risk for pertussis was estimated among infants in rural Nepal. Nepal’s immunization program, which includes a childhood whole cell pertussis vaccine, may be effective in controlling pertussis in infants.Text: A resurgence of pertussis across age groups has occurred in several countries in recent years  . Middle-and high-income countries that use an acellular pertussis vaccine for the primary vaccination series have been particularly affected [2, 3] , and infants and adolescents have experienced the greatest increase  . Factors that may contribute to the increased risk of pertussis include rapidly waning immunity from those vaccinated with acellular vaccines [1, 5, 6] , asymptomatic transmission from individuals vaccinated with acellular vaccines  , genetic adaption of Bordetella pertussis  , vaccination delay or refusal  , improved surveillance and laboratory capabilities  , and overall increased awareness of the continuing circulation of B pertussis  .',\n",
       "  'Some countries experiencing epidemic pertussis, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Argentina, now recommend pertussis immunization in pregnancy and vaccination of close contacts [10, 11] to protect the youngest infants from pertussis before they can be vaccinated themselves  . Recent data from maternal vaccination trials demonstrate the ability of antibodies to be transferred from mothers to their infants in pregnancy and their persistence in infants  .Global estimates of pertussis show the highest childhood burden in Southeast Asia  . In this region, maternal pertussis vaccination during pregnancy may be a way to protect infants, similar to the approach using tetanus toxoid vaccine. However, globally only 1 population-based estimate of pertussis in infants from birth has been conducted (Senegal)  , and surveillance and laboratory capabilities in Asia are lacking [16, 17] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended that countries using whole cell pertussis vaccines continue to do so in light of recent data indicating that acellular pertussis vaccines are less effective than whole cell pertussis vaccines  .',\n",

The objective was to provide a population-based estimate of laboratory-confirmed pertussis incidence in infants less than 6 months of age in the Sarlahi District, Nepal.The study was nested within 2 consecutive randomized controlled trials of maternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy set in the Sarlahi District, located in the central Terai (low-lying plains) region of Nepal  . At the start of the trial, prevalent pregnancies were identified through a census of all households in the catchment area.

None of the additional symptoms related to pertussis that were added in year 2 (cyanosis, apnea, cough with vomit, and whoop) resulted in collection of nasal swabs based solely on these additional symptoms.',\n",
       "  'Pertussis episodes were statistically significantly more likely to include difficulty breathing, cough with vomit, and whoop compared with other respiratory illness. Six infants had at least 1 pertussis vaccination before pertussis disease onset (three <2 weeks and three >2 weeks before pertussis illness) with a mean of 18 days from vaccination to illness compared with 49 days for nonpertussis episodes (P = .03). Five infants received their first pertussis vaccination postpertussis disease onset, whereas 6 infants received no pertussis vaccination in the first 180 days. Three fourths of pertussis episodes were coinfected with at least 1 virus, with RV and BoV the most common. Cases of pertussis were more likely to be infected with BoV than respiratory cases due to causes other than pertussis. The majority of cases occurred between February 2013 and January 2014 (Figure 1) .No statistically significant differences between risk factors for pertussis and nonpertussis cases ( Table 2) were documented.',\n",
       "  'Given the low number of pertussis cases, the lack of a statistical association is not evidence of nonassociation. No deaths occurred in infants who had pertussis. Of the 8 mothers of B pertussis-positive infants who had a nasal swab collected (14 nasal swabs total) during their own follow-up, none were positive for any pertussis species.The 5 B parapertussis cases were primarily male whose mothers were primiparous, literate, and Pahadi ethnicity (Supplementary Table 1 ). No mothers of infants who had B parapertussis had a nasal swab collected during follow-up.The average B parapertussis episode duration was 4 days (Supplementary Table 2 ). Mean age of onset of symptoms was 58 days with a range of 7-95 days. The most common symptoms were cough and wheeze. Rhinovirus and RSV were the only coinfections observed. All B parapertussis cases occurred between September 2011 and February 2012 ( Figure 1 ).A low incidence of pertussis and generally mild clinical presentation were found in infants <6 months in Nepal.',\n",
       "  'To our knowledge, this represents one of the first population-based active surveillance of PCR-confirmed pertussis among young infants in Asia. Acellular pertussis vaccine trials conducted in the 1990s found the average pertussis incidence in the whole cell vaccine groups ranged from 1 to 37 cases per 1000 infantyears  . Our finding of 13 B pertussis cases per 1000 infantyears was on the lower end of this range. In the United States in 2014, the estimated pertussis incidence in infants less than 6 months was 2 cases per 1000 infant-years  , much lower than observed in our study; however, this passive surveillance system likely vastly underestimates pertussis incidence. Thus, there is a need for active surveillance data such as ours. Furthermore, given our highly sensitive case detection method, many of our pertussis cases would likely not have been detected in the previous acellular pertussis vaccine trials.',\n",
       "  \"More stringent respiratory symptom criteria would have lowered our incidence estimate even further. The low incidence was found in a population where pentavalent vaccine (Pentavac: Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis [Whole Cell], Hepatitis-B and Haemophilus Type b Conjugate Vaccine; Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd), scheduled for administration at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, is received with significant delays (7% of infants received all 3 recommended pertussis vaccines by 6 months)  . These data support the WHO's recommendation that countries using whole cell pertussis vaccine continue to do so given that the majority of outbreaks have been concentrated in countries using the acellular pertussis vaccine  . Recent studies suggest that protection from acellular pertussis vaccine is not as strong or long lasting as that conferred by the whole cell pertussis vaccine [6, 28] .Another contributing factor to the low pertussis incidence observed could be that surveillance was conducted during a period of low pertussis transmission.\",\n",
       "  'Pertussis is a cyclical disease, thought to peak every 2 to 4 years, and we may have captured the burden at a low circulation period  . We observed over 70% of our B pertussis cases over a 1-year period. This increase from earlier observation periods could indicate a temporary rise in pertussis consistent with its cyclical pattern or a true increase in the baseline burden. Previous research on pertussis seasonality has in different places and time periods demonstrated various periods of peak transmission or no discernable patterns [29, 30] . Although our data do not support a seasonal pattern, the numbers observed are too low to be conclusive.Pertussis symptom duration and severity were mild compared with the classic pertussis case presentation. Only 3 of the 17 cases fulfilled the WHO criteria, which requires a minimum of 2 weeks of cough, whoop, or posttussive vomiting  .',\n",
       "  'Studies on pertussis in infants have generally been clinic-based, hospital-based, or in an outbreak, which therefore required a certain severity of illness for parents to recognize a need for medical attention [29, 30, 32] . These study designs and passive surveillance efforts therefore may have missed milder pertussis cases  . Our study, which required only 1 respiratory symptom for a nasal swab to be collected, had increased sensitivity to detect a range of pertussis case presentations. An alternative explanation for the mild cases seen could be an increase in the proportion of mild compared with severe pertussis cases in Nepal.Although cough, difficulty breathing, and cough with vomit were the most common symptoms, no symptom was present in all B pertussis cases. During an epidemic period in Washington state, among infants <1 year, who had a minimum of 14 days cough plus an additional symptom, 82% had posttussive emesis, 29% had apnea, 26% had whoop, and 42% had cyanosis  .',\n",
       "  'A study of US neonates with pertussis showed the symptom prevalence to be 97% for cough, 91% for cyanosis, 58% for apnea, and 3% for fever  . Our study found lower or equal symptom prevalence with the exception of fever. Fever prevalence was higher in our study, similar to that found in Peru  .Although not statistically significant, infants with pertussis were more likely to have been born preterm, low birth weight, and SGA, and their mothers were more likely to be primiparous. These findings are similar to previous studies showing no difference in pertussis cases by sex [29, 35, 36] or crowding  but showing differences by birth weight  . Coinfections were common, consistent with findings from other hospital-based studies  . Codetection of B pertussis and B parapertussis with respiratory viruses may be due to asymptomatic pertussis carriage.',\n",
       "  'The incidence of B parapertussis of 4 cases per 1000 person-years was comparable to that of 2 per 1000 person-years found in the Italian acellular pertussis vaccine trial in 1992-1993  . The duration of illness was shorter for B parapertussis with a maximum duration of 6 days compared with a maximum of 33 days for B pertussis. A milder presentation is consistent with clinical knowledge of B parapertussis infection [37, 38] . Bordetella parapertussis cases occurred only during a 5-month period.There were several study design limitations. We cannot be certain whether the reported symptoms were caused by pertussis, another organism, or whether symptoms were related to 2 or more etiologic agents. We were unable to perform multivariate regression modeling for characteristics associated with pertussis disease and pertussis cases due to the small number of cases we detected.Infant respiratory symptoms were reported by parents, who may have missed signs that might have been observed by a healthcare worker.',\n",
       "  'However, the criteria for collection of the nasal swab were broad and did not require sophisticated clinical skills. However, apnea and cyanosis may have been difficult for parents to identify. Although the criteria for specimen collection changed in year 2, no infant experienced a pertussis-specific symptom in isolation without also having one of the originally specified respiratory symptoms. These data support our assumption that we were unlikely to have missed pertussis cases in year 1 with our less sensitive respiratory symptom criteria.Nasal swabs were collected in the mid-nasal region for influenza virus detection, which may have lowered the sensitivity of pertussis detection. In a field site, the acceptability of an additional nasopharyngeal swab would likely have increased the participant refusal rate. This would have decreased the generalizability of our results to the entire population.',\n",
       "  'Although nasopharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates are the recommended specimen collection method  , the nasopharyngeal region was established as the collection area of choice when the diagnostic measure was culture, which has low sensitivity. Recent data demonstrated the comparability of using mid-nasal versus nasopharyngeal swabs in PCR pertussis detection  .Strengths of the study included being a population-based, prospective study, with very low refusal rates. Risk factors, clinical symptoms, and coinfections were prospectively identified without the potential bias that may occur when these data are collected retrospectively or in clinical settings. The community-based design allows generalizability of these results to the entire population and not just those seeking care at a health facility or in an outbreak situation. The Sarlahi District is located in the Terai region where the majority of Nepalese reside, and it has similar demographics to the entire population of Nepal  .',\n",

The weekly active surveillance with sensitive criteria for pertussis testing was able to detect mild and atypical pertussis cases, which may have been missed by previous traditional surveillance. The multitarget PCR method allowed highly sensitive and specific detection of 2 additional Bordetella species beyond the primary B pertussis target.We observed a low incidence of pertussis in infants in a whole cell vaccine environment. Pertussis cases were generally milder than expected compared with traditional pertussis clinical definitions. These data support clinicians considering pertussis in their differential diagnosis of infants with mild respiratory symptoms. Policymakers in Nepal will need to weigh the benefit of an additional prenatal pertussis vaccine or a switch to acellular primary pertussis vaccine with the low burden of pertussis in infants less than 6 months.\",\n",
       "  ' Our study demonstrated that mid-nasal swabs were able to detect pertussis using a sensitive multitarget PCR. The less invasive mid-nasal nasal swab is an attractive alternative for pertussis nasal swab collection, and further research is needed to compare this collection site with nasopharyngeal swabs. In the future, this method may enhance population-based surveillance efforts.'],\n",
       " ['BACKGROUND: The weekly proportion of laboratory tests that are positive for influenza is used in public health surveillance systems to identify periods of influenza activity. We aimed to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The weekly number of influenza-negative tests from 1999 to 2006 was modelled as a function of laboratory-confirmed positive tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses, seasonality, and trend using Poisson regression. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32–34%), varying from 30–40% depending on the season and region. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated sensitivity of influenza tests reported to this national laboratory surveillance system is considerably less than reported test characteristics for most laboratory tests.',\n",
       "  'A number of factors may explain this difference, including sample quality and specimen procurement issues as well as test characteristics. Improved diagnosis would permit better estimation of the burden of influenza.Text: Although influenza virus infection is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality    , laboratory confirmation of clinical illness is the exception rather than the rule. Clinicians do not routinely seek laboratory confirmation for several reasons: diagnosis will often not alter patient management, a paucity of real-time, accurate, inexpensive testing methods  and because influenza is not recognized as the etiology of the clinical presentation  . Accurate diagnosis of influenza-like illness, however, could improve clinical care through reduced use of antibiotics and ancillary testing, and more appropriate use of antiviral therapy  . Although rapid influenza tests such as pointof-care tests are purported to generate results in a timely fashion to influence clinical care, the performance characteristics of the currently available tests are sub-optimal  .',\n",
       "  'New technologies with improved sensitivity such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  as well as the use of more effective collection systems such as the flocked nasopharyngeal swab compared to traditional rayon wound swabs, and the recommendation to collect more ideal specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs rather than throat swabs are likely to improve diagnostic sensitivity     . The performance characteristics of currently available tests for influenza vary considerably and the overall sensitivities of these tests when used in routine practice are also dependent on the type of specimen collected, the age of the patient and point in their illness in which they are sampled [4, 9,    .We sought to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system using a model-based method [1, 2,    .Weekly respiratory virus identifications from September 1999 to August 2006 were obtained from the Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System (RVDSS), Public Health Agency of Canada [19, 20] .',\n",
       "  'The RVDSS collects, collates, and reports weekly data from participating laboratories on the number of tests performed and the number of specimens confirmed positive for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para-influenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus. Specimens are generally submitted to laboratories by clinicians in the course of clinical care, and by clinicians participating in one of our national influenza surveillance programs, (FluWatch  ). Indicators of influenza activity are reported year round on a weekly basis to the FluWatch program. The RVDSS is supplemented by case reports of influenza positive cases [19, 21] . From the case reports, influenza A was confirmed in all age groups and sporadic cases were confirmed in the off-season months of June through September. Infants and children under the age of 5 years accounted for 25% of the influenza A positive tests, and persons over the age 65 years another 35%.',\n",
       "  'Unfortunately, FluWatch surveillance data does not provide the total number of tests by age. Testing practices are known to be varied [22, 23] . The predominant testing methods used for influenza detection varied considerably by province or laboratory and over time. For the 2005/06 season a survey of laboratory techniques in current use indicated that culture accounted for 44% of the diagnostic tests with RT-PCR, rapid antigen tests and direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) accounting for 21%, 19%, and 16% respectively  .The weekly number of tests negative for influenza was modelled, using Poisson regression, as a function of viral identifications for influenza, RSV, adenovirus and PIV as well as a baseline consisting of seasonality, trend and holiday variables.',\n",
       "  'The estimated baseline implicitly accounts for influenza tests on specimens taken from patients with respiratory infections due to respiratory pathogens other than the four viruses captured in the RVDSS, as long as both the testing behaviour of clinicians and respiratory illnesses caused by other respiratory pathogens follow a consistent seasonal pattern as prescribed by the model (see below,The Poisson regression model with a linear link function was estimated using SAS  PROC GENMOD: Coefficients b 5 to b 9 are multipliers. The weekly number of influenza negative tests estimated to be falsely negative is given by b 5 InflA w +b 6 InflB w . The weekly number of influenza negative tests attributed to RSV is given by b 7 RSVp w. , and similarly for adenovirus and PIV. For each positive influenza A test, an additional b 5 tests above baseline were performed and found to be negative.',\n",
       "  'By specifying a linear link, a value of 0.33, say, for coefficient b 5 , means that for every test for which influenza A was confirmed, 0.33 additional tests, on average, were performed on truly influenza A positive specimens and found to be negativewhich corresponds to a sensitivity of 75%.Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests, or equivalently, the estimates of sensitivity for influenza A and B are given by 1/ (1+b 5 ) and 1/(1+b 6 ) respectively. The false negative rate is 1 minus sensitivity. While the null value for b 5 is zero, which indicates no statistical association between the number of influenza positive tests and the number of influenza negative tests, the corresponding null value for sensitivity is 1.For each test confirmed positive for RSV, on average b 7 tests were performed for influenza and found to be negative for influenza.',\n",
       "  'These b 7 tests are attributed to an RSV infection, however the number of influenza-negative tests that actually tested positive for RSV is unknown. If all specimens had been tested for the same viruses (panel tests), 1/b 7 would correspond to the sensitivity for RSV testing, and the sensitivity for adenovirus and PIV given by 1/b 8 and 1/b 9 respectively. Some laboratories are known to test for viruses sequentially  , and so 1/b 7 -1/b 9 were not interpreted as estimates of the sensitivity for other viruses. Sequential testing may occur if a rapid test for influenza is negative and the laboratory then performs PCR or culture testing. Similarly in young children with a respiratory illness in the winter, rapid tests for RSV infection may be performed first, and only specimens with negative results submitted for subsequent testing for influenza or other respiratory viruses  .',\n",
       "  'By contrast, many laboratories conduct panel tests for multiple viruses for ease of handling, decreased patient sampling, and recognition that coinfection can occur. Either form of sequential testing would not bias the estimate of sensitivity applicable to test results reported to RVDSS, though significant use of rapid antigen tests in the laboratories reporting to RVDSS would reduce the overall sensitivity. As a single specimen may undergo multiple tests, the false-negative rate applicable to a specimen that has undergone multiple tests would be expected to be much lower than the system average for individual tests. Parameters b 1. to b 4 account for trends and the seasonality of truly negative specimens (patients presenting with other acute respiratory infections).Over 50,000 tests for influenza were reported to the RVDSS each year, peaking in 2004/05 at 101,000. Overall 10% of the influenza tests were positive for influenza, ranging from 4% to 13% depending on the season.',\n",
       "  'The proportion positive for RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus averaged 9%, 3% and 2% respectively. As seen in Figure 1 , no virus was identified in 75% of specimens submitted for testing (white area under the curve). Even for the winter months of December through April, one of these 4 viruses was identified on average in no more than 30% of the specimens. The strong and consistent synchronization of negative tests with influenza positive tests, as seen in Figure 1 , is suggestive that false negative results contributed to the large number of negative tests during periods of influenza activity.The sensitivity for influenza A testing averaged 33.7% (with model-estimated 95% confidence intervals of 33.3-34.1) for the 1999/2000-2005/06 period. Influenza B testing had a similar estimated sensitivity at 34.7 (95% CI 33.4-36.1). Estimated sensitivities varied somewhat from season to season, generally ranging from 30%-40% (Table 1) , and provincial level estimates, as well, were within a similar range.',\n",
       "  'Stratifying by province or season produced similar estimates for the sensitivity of influenza A testing: 32% (95% CI 30-34) and 36% (95% CI 33-41) respectively. Estimates of sensitivity based on test results reported to the RVDSS for individual laboratories with sufficient data to fit the model showed significant variation, with estimates of sensitivity ranging from 25-65%. As expected, laboratories using primarily rapid antigen tests had lower estimated sensitivities, and laboratories that used PCR methods had higher sensitivity estimates. However, information on testing procedures is limited primarily to the 2005/06 survey. As well, additional irregularities were noticed in the laboratory data and not all laboratories provided sufficient data to fit the model. Figure 2 illustrates a good model fit where the weekly number of influenza negative tests is well explained by the model covariates, with a few exceptions.',\n",
       "  'Firstly, it is evident that additional specimens were tested during the SARS period, as indicated by the period where the number of weekly influenza negative tests exceeded the expected number, or equivalently, a period of successive positive residuals. Residuals typically capture random variation; hence represent tests that can not be allocated based on the specified model. In addition to the SARS period, testing appears to have been elevated for a number of weeks in January 2000 during the peak of the 1999/2000 A/ Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) season in which respiratory admissions were unusually elevated [26, 27] , and in December 2003, when an elevated risk of paediatric deaths associated with the A/Fujian/411/02 (H3N2) strain  was identified in the US. As these periods corresponded to a period of heightened public awareness due to severe influenza outbreaks, parameter estimation was repeated without these data points.',\n",
       "  'Exclusion of these data points did not alter the sensitivity estimate for influenza.The attribution of influenza negative test results to influenza and other viruses is illustrated in Figure 3 . The baseline curve is the model estimate of the number of tests that were likely truly negative for all four viruses tested. A reduction in specimen collection and testing, primarily for viruses other than influenza, is also evident over the Christmas period ( Figure 3) .The weekly proportion of tests confirmed positive for influenza peaked each season at 15 to 30%. Accounting for the model estimated false negative rate suggests that during periods of peak influenza activity, 40-90% of tests were performed on specimens taken from persons recently infected with influenza. Influenza was confirmed in only 14% of specimens sent for testing over the winter period, whereas the sensitivity estimate would imply that up to 40% of influenza tests could be attributed to an influenza infection.',\n",
       "  'The corresponding figures for the whole year indicate that 10% of specimens were confirmed positive for influenza and 30% of influenza tests could be model-attributed to an influenza infection annually.Despite a relatively large number of tests in the off-season, the number of influenza positive tests was almost negligible; suggesting that the false positive rate applicable to RVDSS influenza testing is minimal.The model estimated sensitivity based on influenza test results reported to the RVDSS of 30-40% is much lower than the standard assay sensitivities documented in the literature. Standard sensitivities for diagnostic procedures used by participating laboratories ranged from 64% for rapid antigen tests to 95% for RT-PCR tests, averaging 75% for the study period  . As performance characteristics of specific tests are generally based on high quality specimens, the difference of approximately 40% is likely linked to any one of many operational procedures that affects the quality of the specimen and its procurement.',\n",
       "  'Unlike validation studies, our samples are taken from a variety of clinical settings and processed with a variety of procedures across the country. As well, variation in the indications for diagnostic testing may vary across the country.As there are many other respiratory pathogens that are not routinely tested for, or reported to the RVDSS, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses for which patients may seek medical care and present with influenza like illness     , a large proportion of negative test results was expected. The overall model fit, and the general consistency of the sensitivity estimates, suggests that these many respiratory viruses were reasonably accounted for by the seasonal baseline and that the strong association between the number of influenza positive and influenza negative tests on a weekly basis is indicative of a significant number of false negative results, rather than the activity of another virus or viruses exactly synchronous with influenza.',\n",
       "  'The latter would bias the estimated sensitivity of the system downwards. However, to significantly and consistently bias the estimate, the degree of synchronization would have to be fairly strong, persist over the whole study period, and occur in all provinces. Synchronization was not observed among the RVDSS viruses (influenza A, influenza B, RSV, adenovirus and PIV), and elsewhere other viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus and hMPV accounted for only a small proportion of the viral identifications and were not found to be synchronized with influenza  . As well, patients may present for care due to a secondary bacterial infection. While any specimen would likely test negative as the virus, at this point, is likely not detectable, the model would statistically attribute a negative test in this case to the primary infection; one of the four RVDSS viruses or to the seasonal baseline that represents other respiratory infections, depending on the level of viral activity at the time of the test.',\n",
       "  'This is not considered a source of bias.The large variation in false negative rates estimated for individual laboratories reporting to the RVDSS suggests that standardization of sample procurement, testing and reporting procedures would likely reduce the overall false negative rate. The accuracy of diagnostic tests is known to be affected by the quality of the specimen [10, 11] , its handling, the timing of collection after symptom onset, and the age of the patient [14, 15] . Even with the most sensitive molecular methodologies, yield was shown to be strongly related to the time since onset of symptoms [9, 14] , with a 3-fold decline in proportion positive within 3 to 5 days after onset of symptoms for both RT-PCR and culture procedures. For most laboratory tests, specimen procurement within 72 hours of from the onset of symptoms is recommended  , yet patients often present much later in the course of illness.',\n",
       "  'Estimates of the median time since onset of symptoms suggest a delay of 3 and 5 days for outpatient and inpatients respectively  , however these estimates are limited to patients with laboratory confirmed influenza. In addition, there are inherent differences in the performance characteristics of the currently used diagnostic tests [4, 6, 8,      . Lack of standardization between diagnostic tests and algorithms used in different laboratories reporting to the RVDSS adds to this complexity. The routine use of RT-PCR testing has only recently become available in Canada (only 20% of tests used RT-PCR methods as of 2005/06  ), but increased use of this modality is expected to improve accuracy.Population or system level sensitivity estimates that include the effects of sample quality are limited.',\n",
       "  'Grijalva and colleagues  estimated the diagnostic sensitivity in a capture recapture study of children hospitalized for respiratory complications at 69% for a RT-PCR based system and 39% for a clinical-laboratory based system (passive surveillance of tests performed during clinical practice, and using a variety of commercially available tests).Though the expected proportion of influenza tests that were due to influenza infections is unknown and variable, our model estimate of 30% appears plausible. Cooper and colleagues  attributed 22% of telephone health calls for cold/flu to influenza over two relatively mild years, and elsewhere 20% of admissions for acute respiratory infections (including influenza) in adults aged 20-64 years were attributed to influenza, and 42% for seniors  .While there are limitations with this approach, there are no other simple alternatives to assist in the interpretation of the RVDSS data. It would have been helpful to analyze data based on each specimen sent for testing.',\n",
       "  'With only the number of weekly tests and number of positive results, we were unable to calculate the number of specimens that were actually found to be negative for all four viruses, or to estimate the extent of co-infection. Coinfection, which was not accounted for in our model, could result in an under-estimation of the number of falsely negative tests, as the attribution of an influenza negative test that was actually coinfected with influenza and another respiratory virus would have to be split between the viruses. With auxiliary information associated with each specimen, model estimates of false negative rates based on, for example, test type, time since onset of symptoms, age of the patient, or clinical presentation would have allowed us to explore the reasons for the high false negative rates. As the false negative rate appears to be laboratory dependant (data not shown), this estimated range is applicable only to the RVDSS for the study period.',\n",
       "  'A significant reduction in the false negative rate is anticipated as methods become standardized and with the uptake of the new RT-PCR methods. As positive results, particularly for culture, are often obtained a week or more after the specimen was received, some positive results may have been reported in a different week than the test. Multiple test results for a single specimen may have also contributed to reporting irregularities. These irregularities would tend to bias the estimated parameter towards zero, and hence the estimated sensitivity towards 1. Considering the overall model fit and the relative severity of influenza  , we conclude that our estimate of sensitivity may be slightly over-estimated (number of false negatives under-estimated).Poor test sensitivity contributes to the chronic underestimation of the burden of influenza in the general population. Since estimates of the burden of illness drive planning for preventive and therapeutic interventions, it is important to improve all aspects leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.',\n",
       "  ' We have illustrated a simple method that uses the surveillance data itself to estimate the system wide sensitivity associated with the weekly proportion of tests confirmed positive. Although our estimate of sensitivity is only applicable to the interpretation of the RVDSS data over the study period, similar estimates for specific cohorts or laboratory procedures may help guide further investigation into the reasons for the large number of false negative test results. The capacity for improved diagnostic accuracy will ultimately improve our understanding of the epidemiology of influenza.'],\n",
       " ['The mammalian genome has evolved to encode a battery of mechanisms, to mitigate a progression in the life cycle of an invasive viral pathogen. Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression.',\n",
       "  'This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.Text: Establishment of infection by a virus, even in permissive host cells, is beset with a plethora of challenges from innate-antiviral and cell-death pathways. Therefore, the host response to a virus infection might prove to be inhibitory for the viral life cycle in a direct or an indirect manner.',\n",
       "  'The direct mechanism involves expression of multiple anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid (Zhou et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2011) . On the other hand the pathways, e.g., those that culminate in initiating an apoptotic death for the host cell, indirectly serve to limit the spread of virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . A major difference between these two mechanisms is that while the former response is transmissible to neighboring uninfected cells through interferon (IFN) signaling, the latter is observed mostly in cis. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated transmission of an apoptotic signal between cells that are in contact through gap junctions, although such a signaling from an virus infected host cell to an uninfected one is not known yet (Cusato et al., 2003; Udawatte and Ripps, 2005; Kameritsch et al., 2013) .',\n",
       "  'Successful viral pathogens, through a process of active selection, have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. The viral nucleic acids which could be the genome (positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus) or RNA derived from transcription of the genome [negative-stranded single-sense RNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA virus], offer critical targets for both detection and eradication. The viral nucleic acid targeting armaments in the host arsenal include those that recognize the associated molecular patterns like toll-like receptors (TLRs), DDX58 (or RIG-1), IFIH1 (or MDA5), IFIT proteins [IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)56 and ISF54], etc. (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012) . This is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification like OAS/ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system, APOBEC3, MCPIP1, the ZC3HAV1/exosome system and RNAi pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Sheehy et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2007; Daffis et al., 2010; Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013a; Lin et al., 2013) .',\n",

The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage.

       "  'The genes that are regulated as a result of IFN signaling are termed as IFN-stimulated or IFN-regulated genes (ISGs or IRGs; Sen and Sarkar, 2007; Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Oligoadenylate synthetase or OAS genes are canonical ISGs that convert ATP into 2 -5 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) by an unique enzymatic mechanism (Figure 1 ; Hartmann et al., 2003) . Further, they are RNA-binding proteins that function like PRRs, in a way that the 2-5A synthesizing activity needs to be induced through an interaction with dsRNA (Minks et al., 1979; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In a host cell infected by an RNA virus, such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI), which are synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently used by the same enzyme to synthesize more genomic RNA, through asymmetric transcription (Weber et al., 2006) .',\n",
       "  'However, the replications complexes (RCs) harboring these RI molecules are found secluded inside host-membrane derived vesicles, at least in positive-strand RNA viruses, a group which contains many human pathogens (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Denison, 2008) . Reports from different groups suggest OAS proteins to be distributed both in the cytoplasm as well as in membrane-associated fractions, perhaps indicating an evolution of the host anti-viral methodologies towards detection of the membrane-associated viral dsRNAs (Marie et al., 1990; Lin et al., 2009) . DNA viruses on the other hand, produce dsRNA by annealing of RNA derived from transcription of both strands in the same viral genomic loci, which are probably detected by the cytoplasmic pool of OAS proteins (Jacobs and Langland, 1996; Weber et al., 2006) . Post-activation the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5A molecules in a non-processive reaction producing oligomers which, although potentially ranging in size from dimeric to multimeric, are functionally active only in a trimeric or tetrameric form (Dong et al., 1994; Sarkar et al., 1999; Silverman, 2007) .',\n",
       "  'These small ligands, which bear phosphate groups (1-3) at the 5 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions, serve as co-factor which can specifically interact with and thereby allosterically activate, existing RNaseL molecules (Knight et al., 1980; Zhou et al., 1997 Zhou et al., , 2005 Sarkar et al., 1999) . As part of a physiological control system these 2-5A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5 -phosphatases and PDE12 (2 -phosphodiesterase; Silverman et al., 1981; Johnston and Hearl, 1987; Kubota et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2012) . Viral strategies to evade or overcome this host defense mechanism ranges from preventing IFN signaling which would hinder the induction of OAS expression or thwarting activation of expressed OAS proteins by either shielding the viral dsRNA from interacting with it or modulating the host pathway to synthesize inactive 2-5A derivatives (Cayley et al., 1984; Hersh et al., 1984; Rice et al., 1985; Maitra et al., 1994; Beattie et al., 1995; Rivas et al., 1998; Child et al., 2004; Min and Krug, 2006; Sanchez and Mohr, 2007; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .',\n",

The activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD, which is relieved upon binding of 2-5A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration (Figure 1 ; Hassel et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2005) . In support of this contention, deletion of the ARD has been demonstrated to produce constitutively active RNaseL, although with dramatically lower RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1997) .',\n",
       "  'However, recent reports suggest that while 2-5A links the ankyrin repeats from adjacent molecules leading to formation of dimer and higher order structures, at sufficiently high in vitro concentrations, RNaseL could oligomerize even in the absence of 2-5A . Nonetheless, in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2-5A (Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . In order to exploit this dependence, multiple viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rotavirus group A (RVA) have evolved to encode phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolysing the 2 -5 linkages in 2-5A and thereby attenuate the RNaseL cleavage activity (Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) .

Direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 Townsend et al., 2008; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .Once activated by 2-5A, RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin (virus or host) although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Silverman et al., 1983; Li et al., 1998) .',\n",
       "  'RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich with the cleavage points being typically at the 3 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5 -OH and a 3 -monophosphate in the cleavage product (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981b) . A recent report shows a more general consensus of 5 -UNN-3 with the cleavage point between the second and the third nucleotide (Han et al., 2014) . Cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs, the latter predominantly representing genes involved in protein biosynthesis (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2009) . Additionally, RNaseL activity can also degrade specific ISG mRNA transcripts and thereby attenuate the effect of IFN signaling (Li et al., 2000) .',\n",
       "  'Probably an evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity is observed in the coding region of mammalian genes where the UU/UA dinucleotide frequency is rarer (Bisbal et al., 2000; Khabar et al., 2003; Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . Perhaps not surprisingly, with a much faster rate of evolution, similar observations have been made with respect to evasion of RNaseL mediated degradation by viral RNAs too (Han and Barton, 2002; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Moreover, nucleoside modifications in host mRNAs, rarely observed in viral RNAs, have also been shown to confer protection from RNaseL (Anderson et al., 2011) . In addition to directly targeting viral RNA, the reduction in functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA affects viral protein synthesis and replication in an indirect manner. Probably, as a reflection of these effects on cellular RNAs, RNaseL is implicated as one of the factors determining the anti-proliferative effect of IFN activity .',\n",
       "  'The anti-viral activity of RNaseL extends beyond direct cleavage of viral RNA, through stimulation of RIG-I by the cleavage product (Malathi et al., , 2007 (Malathi et al., , 2010 . A global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis, probably as a consequence of rRNA cleavage (Li et al., 2004; Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) . RNaseL has also been demonstrated to play a role in apoptotic cell death initiated by pharmacological agents extending the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 .The ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane for its function.',\n",
       "  'An exclusive microenvironment (high Calcium ion and unique ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione) along with a battery of ER-lumen resident enzymes (foldases, chaperones, and lectins) catalyse/mediate the necessary folding, disulfide-bond formation, and glycosylation reactions (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005) . A perturbation of the folding capacity, due to either physiological disturbances or virus infection, can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors namely IRE1 or ERN1, PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK or EIF2AK3) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6; Hetz, 2012) . IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector (Figure 1 ; Chen and Brandizzi, 2013) .',\n",
       "  'The IRE1 coding gene is present in genomes ranging from yeast to mammals and in the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Signal transduction by stimulated IRE1 initiates multiple gene regulatory pathways with either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic consequences (Kaufman, 1999) . During homeostasis or unstressed conditions the sensor molecules are monomeric, a state maintained co-operatively by the \" absence\" of unfolded proteins and the \"presence\" of HSPA5 (GRP78 or Bip, an ERresident chaperone) molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus (Credle et al., 2005) . Accumulated unfolded proteins in the lumen triggers coupling of this domain from adjacent sensor molecules through a combination of (a) titration of the bound HSPA5 chaperone molecules and (b) direct tethering by malfolded protein molecules (Shamu and Walter, 1996; Credle et al., 2005; Aragon et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009) .',\n",
       "  'Abutting of the luminal domains juxtapose the cytosolic C-terminal segments, leading to an aggregation of the IRE1 molecules into distinct ER-membrane foci (Kimata et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . The C-terminal segment has a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 1998 Tirasophon et al., , 2000 . A trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Korennykh et al., 2009) . In fact, exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE1 (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Once activated, IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain, in addition to phosphorylating and thereby activating JNK (Cox and Walter, 1996; Urano et al., 2000) .',\n",
       "  'Depending on the RNA substrate, the cleavage catalyzed by IRE1 RNase produces differential consequence. Although scission of the Xbp1 mRNA transcript at two internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products, that in all other known IRE1 target RNA is followed by degradation (Figure 1 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Calfon et al., 2002) . The latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Oikawa et al., 2007; Iqbal et al., 2008; Lipson et al., 2008) . Gene transcripts regulated by RIDD pathway includes that from IRE1 (i.e., selftranscripts), probably in a negative feedback loop mechanism (Tirasophon et al., 2000) .',\n",
       "  'In addition to protein coding RNA, RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of a host of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe (Korennykh et al., 2011; Upton et al., 2012) .The IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknown ligase in mammalian cells, to produce the Xbp1s (s for spliced) mRNA transcript (Figure 1 ; Yoshida et al., 2001) . The Xbp1s thus generated has a longer ORF, which is created by a frame-shift in the coding sequence downstream of the splice site (Cox and Walter, 1996; Calfon et al., 2002) . A similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is also observed to initiate the XRN1 and Ski2-3-8 dependent degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) .',\n",
       "  'The RIDD target transcript genes are predominantly those that encode membrane-associated or secretory proteins and which are not necessary for ER proteinfolding reactions (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) and the ERAD pathway genes (to degrade terminally misfolded proteins) whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen (Lee et al., 2003; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . On the other hand, cleavage of pre-miRNA transcripts which are processed in the cell to generate CASPASE-2 mRNA (Casp2) controlling miRNAs, constitutes the pro-apoptotic function of IRE1 (Upton et al., 2012) . Another pro-apoptotic signal from IRE1 emanates from signaling through phosphorylation of JNK1 (Urano et al., 2000) .',\n",
       "  'Although in the initial phase RIDD activity does not cleave mRNAs encoding essential ER proteins, at later stages of chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction (Han et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .Infection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor(s; Su et al., 2002; Tardif et al., 2002; He, 2006; Yu et al., 2006 Yu et al., , 2013 Medigeshi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Among these at least two viruses from diverse families, HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus), interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism (Tardif et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2013 ). An observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it, which the virus has evolved to evade through blocking some critical step(s).',\n",
       "  'In both the cases mentioned above, stability of the viral proteins seems to be affected by ERAD-mediated degradation, although other potential anti-viral effect of IRE1 activation are not clear yet (Isler et al., 2005; Saeed et al., 2011) . Interestingly, host mRNA fragments produced following IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling (Figure 1 ; Cho et al., 2013b) . Theoretically, other functions of IRE1 can also have anti-viral effect necessitating its inhibition for uninhibited viral replication. It is, however, still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA (or mRNA) in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets (Figure 1) . The possibilities of such a direct anti-viral function are encouraged by the fact that all these viruses encode at least one protein which, as part of its maturation process, requires glycosylation and disulfide-bond formation.',\n",
       "  'Such a necessity would entail translation of the mRNA encoding such a protein, which in case of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses would mean the genome, in association with the ER-membrane (Figure 1 ; Lerner et al., 2003) . Additionally for many RNA viruses, replication complexes are housed in ER-derived vesicular structures (Denison, 2008; den Boon et al., 2010) . Considering the proximity of IRE1 and these virus-derived RNAs it is tempting to speculate that probably at some point of time in the viral life cycle one or more virus-associated RNA would be susceptible to cleavage by IRE1. However, studies with at least two viruses have shown that instead of increasing viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has an opposite effect (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .',\n",
       "  'This implies potential benefits of IRE1 activation through one or more of the following, (a) expression of chaperones or other pro-viral molecules downstream of XBP1Supregulation or JNK-activation, (b) cleavage of potential anti-viral gene mRNA transcripts by RIDD activity. However, the mode of protection for the viral RNA from RIDD activity is still not clear. It is possible that the viral proteins create a subdomain within the ER membrane, which through some mechanism excludes IRE1 from diffusing near the genomic RNA, thereby protecting the replication complexes (Denison, 2008) . It is therefore probably not surprising that single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains (Egger et al., 2000) . The fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates such an exclusion of the activated sensor molecules from vicinity of the viral replication complexes.',\n",
       "  'The UPR signaling eventually attenuate during chronic ER-stress and since that is what a virus-induced UPR mimics, probably the viral RNA needs protection only during the initial phase of UPR activation (Lin et al., 2007) . Since the choice of RIDD target seems to be grossly driven towards mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins, it is also possible that one or more viral protein have evolved to mimic a host protein the transcript of which is RIDD-resistant (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage (Figure 1 ; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Although ER-association for an mRNA is possible without the mediation of ribosomes, Gaddam and co-workers reported that continued association with polysomes for a membrane-bound mRNA can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage (Cui et al., 2012; Gaddam et al., 2013) .',\n",
       "  'This would suggest important implications for the observed refractory nature of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and influenza virus RNA to RIDD cleavage (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . In contrast to Influenza virus, flaviviruses (which include JEV) do not suppress host protein synthesis implying the absence of a global inhibition on translation as would be expected during UPR (Clyde et al., 2006; Edgil et al., 2006) . Therefore, a continued translation of viral RNA in spite of UPR activation can in principle confer protection from the pattern of RNA cleavage observed in the RIDD pathway.IRE1 and RNaseL, in addition to biochemical similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain, share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Liu and Lin, 2005; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008) .',\n",
       "  'Though initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral role for the former and latter, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. In the same vein, while inhibition of IRE1 signaling in virus infected cells indicates a potential anti-viral role, www.frontiersin.org (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Dong and Silverman, 1999; Papa et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007) Nature of RNase substrates Both 28S rRNA and mRNAs IRE1β can cleave both 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1α substrates include only mRNAs (Iwawaki et al., 2001) DissimilaritiesCleavage substrates Beside 28S rRNA, predominantly cleaves mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2009) Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors which are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites (Han et al., 2014) RNA sequence with the consensus of 5 -CUGCAG-3 in association with a stem-loop (SL) structure essential for recognition of Xbp1u and other mRNAs (Oikawa et al., 2010) association of RNaseL mutations with generation of prostate cancer extends the ambit of influence of this anti-viral effector to more non-infectious physiological disorders (Silverman, 2003) .',\n",
       "  'Biochemically, the similarity in their RNase domains does not extend to the choice of either substrates or cleavage point, which are downstream of UU or UA in RNaseL and downstream of G (predominantly) for IRE1 ( Figure 2C ; Yoshida et al., 2001; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Upton et al., 2012) . Further, while RNaseL cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region, IRE1 seems to cleave equally well in single-and double-stranded region (Upton et al., 2012) . However, a recent report suggested a consensus cleavage site with the sequence UN/N, in RNaseL targets and in those mRNAs that are cleaved by IRE1 as part of the RIDD pathway (Han et al., 2014) . Access to potential cleavage substrate for RNaseL is conjectured to be facilitated through its association with polyribosomes, while no such association is known for IRE1 (Salehzada et al., 1991) .',\n",
       "  'Possibilities exist that IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.In the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions.'],\n",

Therefore, NRs have become a frequent target for drug development. During the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting NRs, we are often facing a problem: Given a NR and chemical compound, can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell? To address this problem, a predictor called “iNR-Drug” was developed. In the predictor, the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-D (dimensional) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint, and the NR by a 500-D vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition, and the prediction engine was operated by the SVM (support vector machine) algorithm.',\n",

Although NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is indeed a very powerful tool in determining the 3D structures of membrane proteins as indicated by a series of recent publications (see, e.g.,         and a review article  ), it is also time-consuming and costly.

       "  'Suppose the sequence of a nuclear receptor protein P with L residues is generally expressed bywhere 1 R represents the 1st residue of the protein sequence P , 2 R the 2nd residue, and so forth. Now the problem is how to effectively represent the sequence of Equation (3) with a non-sequential or discrete model  . This is because all the existing operation engines, such as covariance discriminant (CD) [17, 65,        , neural network    , support vector machine (SVM)    83] , random forest [84, 85] , conditional random field  , nearest neighbor (NN) [86, 87] ; K-nearest neighbor (KNN)    , OET-KNN     , and Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor [10, 12, 18, 69, 95] , can only handle vector but not sequence samples. However, a vector defined in a discrete model may completely lose all the sequence-order information and hence limit the quality of prediction. Facing such a dilemma, can we find an approach to partially incorporate the sequence-order effects?',\n",
       "  \"Actually, one of the most challenging problems in computational biology is how to formulate a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector, yet still keep considerable sequence order information. To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for proteins, the pseudo amino acid composition [96, 97] or Chou's PseAAC  was proposed. Ever since the concept of PseAAC was proposed in 2001  , it has penetrated into almost all the areas of computational proteomics, such as predicting anticancer peptides  , predicting protein subcellular location        , predicting membrane protein types [107, 108] , predicting protein submitochondria locations     , predicting GABA(A) receptor proteins  , predicting enzyme subfamily classes  , predicting antibacterial peptides  , predicting supersecondary structure  , predicting bacterial virulent proteins  , predicting protein structural class  , predicting the cofactors of oxidoreductases  , predicting metalloproteinase family  , identifying cysteine S-nitrosylation sites in proteins  , identifying bacterial secreted proteins  , identifying antibacterial peptides  , identifying allergenic proteins  , identifying protein quaternary structural attributes [123, 124] , identifying risk type of human papillomaviruses  , identifying cyclin proteins  , identifying GPCRs and their types [15, 16] , discriminating outer membrane proteins  , classifying amino acids  , detecting remote homologous proteins  , among many others (see a long list of papers cited in the References section of  ).\",\n",
       "  'Moreover, the concept of PseAAC was further extended to represent the feature vectors of nucleotides  , as well as other biological samples (see, e.g.,    ). Because it has been widely and increasingly used, recently two powerful soft-wares, called \"PseAAC-Builder\"  and \"propy\"  , were established for generating various special Chou\\'s pseudo-amino acid compositions, in addition to the web-server \"PseAAC\"  built in 2008.According to a comprehensive review  , the general form of PseAAC for a protein sequence P is formulated bywhere the subscript \\uf057 is an integer, and its value as well as the components ( 1, 2, , ) u u \\uf079 \\uf03d\\uf057 will depend on how to extract the desired information from the amino acid sequence of P (cf. Equation (3)). Below, let us describe how to extract useful information to define the components of PseAAC for the NR samples concerned.',\n",
       "  'First, many earlier studies (see, e.g.,       ) have indicated that the amino acid composition (AAC) of a protein plays an important role in determining its attributes. The AAC contains 20 components with each representing the occurrence frequency of one of the 20 native amino acids in the protein concerned. Thus, such 20 AAC components were used here to define the first 20 elements in Equation (4); i.e., (1) ( 1, 2, , 20) ii fi \\uf079 \\uf03d\\uf03d (5) where f i (1) is the normalized occurrence frequency of the i-th type native amino acid in the nuclear receptor concerned. Since AAC did not contain any sequence order information, the following steps were taken to make up this shortcoming.To avoid completely losing the local or short-range sequence order information, we considered the approach of dipeptide composition. It contained 20 × 20 = 400 components  .',\n",
       "  'Such 400 components were used to define the next 400 elements in Equation (4); i.e., (2) 20 ( 1, 2, , 400) jj fjwhere (2) j f is the normalized occurrence frequency of the j-th dipeptides in the nuclear receptor concerned. To incorporate the global or long-range sequence order information, let us consider the following approach. According to molecular evolution, all biological sequences have developed starting out from a very limited number of ancestral samples. Driven by various evolutionary forces such as mutation, recombination, gene conversion, genetic drift, and selection, they have undergone many changes including changes of single residues, insertions and deletions of several residues  , gene doubling, and gene fusion. With the accumulation of these changes over a long period of time, many original similarities between initial and resultant amino acid sequences are gradually faded out, but the corresponding proteins may still share many common attributes  , such as having basically the same biological function and residing at a same subcellular location [144, 145] .',\n",
       "  'To extract the sequential evolution information and use it to define the components of Equation (4), the PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix) was used as described below.According to Schaffer  , the sequence evolution information of a nuclear receptor protein P with L amino acid residues can be expressed by a 20 L\\uf0b4 matrix, as given bywhere (7) were generated by using PSI-BLAST  to search the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt); http://www.uniprot.org/) through three iterations with 0.001 as the E-value cutoff for multiple sequence alignment against the sequence of the nuclear receptor concerned.',\n",

SVM has been widely used in the realm of bioinformatics (see, e.g.,        ). The basic idea of SVM is to transform the data into a high dimensional feature space, and then determine the optimal separating hyperplane using a kernel function. For a brief formulation of SVM and how it works, see the papers [155, 156] ; for more details about SVM, see a monograph  .In this study, the LIBSVM package  was used as an implementation of SVM, which can be downloaded from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/, the popular radial basis function (RBF) was taken as the kernel function.',\n",
       "  'For the current SVM classifier, there were two uncertain parameters: penalty parameter C and kernel parameter \\uf067 . The method of how to determine the two parameters will be given later.The predictor obtained via the aforementioned procedure is called iNR-Drug, where \"i\" means identify, and \"NR-Drug\" means the interaction between nuclear receptor and drug compound. To provide an intuitive overall picture, a flowchart is provided in Figure 2 to show the process of how the predictor works in identifying the interactions between nuclear receptors and drug compounds. To provide a more intuitive and easier-to-understand method to measure the prediction quality, the following set of metrics based on the formulation used by Chou    in predicting signal peptides was adopted.',\n",
       "  \"According to Chou's formulation, the sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and Matthew's correlation coefficient can be respectively expressed as [62,    Sn 1where N \\uf02b is the total number of the interactive NR-drug pairs investigated while N \\uf02b \\uf02d the number of the interactive NR-drug pairs incorrectly predicted as the non-interactive NR-drug pairs; N \\uf02d the total number of the non-interactive NR-drug pairs investigated while N \\uf02d \\uf02b the number of the non-interactive NR-drug pairs incorrectly predicted as the interactive NR-drug pairs.According to Equation (23) we can easily see the following. When 0 N \\uf02b \\uf02d \\uf03d meaning none of the interactive NR-drug pairs was mispredicted to be a non-interactive NR-drug pair, we have the sensitivity Sn = 1; while NN \\uf02b\\uf02b \\uf02d \\uf03d meaning that all the interactive NR-drug pairs were mispredicted to be the non-interactive NR-drug pairs, we have the sensitivity Sn = 0 .\",\n",
       "  \"Likewise, when 0 N \\uf02d \\uf02b \\uf03d meaning none of the non-interactive NR-drug pairs was mispredicted, we have the specificity Sp we have MCC = 0 meaning total disagreement between prediction and observation. As we can see from the above discussion, it is much more intuitive and easier to understand when using Equation (23) to examine a predictor for its four metrics, particularly for its Mathew's correlation coefficient. It is instructive to point out that the metrics as defined in Equation (23) are valid for single label systems; for multi-label systems, a set of more complicated metrics should be used as given in  .How to properly test a predictor for its anticipated success rates is very important for its development as well as its potential application value. Generally speaking, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine the quality of a predictor and its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling or K-fold (such as five-fold, seven-fold, or 10-fold) crossover test and jackknife test  .\",\n",
       "  'However, as elaborated by a penetrating analysis in  , considerable arbitrariness exists in the independent dataset test. Also, as demonstrated in  , the subsampling (or K-fold crossover validation) test cannot avoid arbitrariness either. Only the jackknife test is the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset [73, 74, 156,    . Therefore, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly utilized by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [14, 15, 68, 99, 106, 107, 124, 169, 170] ). Accordingly, in this study the jackknife test was also adopted to evaluate the accuracy of the current predictor.As mentioned above, the SVM operation engine contains two uncertain parameters C and \\uf067 . To find their optimal values, a 2-D grid search was conducted by the jackknife test on the benchmark dataset .',\n",
       "  'The results thus obtained are shown in Figure 3 , from which it can be seen that the iNR-Drug predictor reaches its optimal status when C = 2 3 and 9 2 \\uf067 \\uf02d \\uf03d . The corresponding rates for the four metrics (cf. Equation (23)) are given in Table 1 , where for facilitating comparison, the overall accuracy Acc reported by He et al. on the same benchmark dataset is also given although no results were reported by them for Sn, Sp and MCC. It can be observed from the table that the overall accuracy obtained by iNR-Drug is remarkably higher that of He et al. , and that the rates achieved by iNR-Drug for the other three metrics are also quite higher. These facts indicate that the current predictor not only can yield higher overall prediction accuracy but also is quite stable with low false prediction rates.',\n",
       "  'As mentioned above (Section 3.2), the jackknife test is the most objective method for examining the quality of a predictor. However, as a demonstration to show how to practically use the current predictor, we took 41 NR-drug pairs from the study by Yamanishi et al. that had been confirmed by experiments as interactive pairs. For such an independent dataset, 34 were correctly identified by iNR-Drug as interactive pairs, i.e., Sn = 34 / 41 = 82.92%, which is quite consistent with the rate of 79.07% achieved by the predictor on the benchmark dataset via the jackknife test as reported in Table 1 .It is anticipated that the iNR-Drug predictor developed in this paper may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well.',\n",

The 7 conserved replicase domains of these viruses possessed <90% aa sequence identity to those of other known alpha-CoVs, which defines a new species in accordance with the ICTV taxonomy standard  .

Strain RaGD from R. affinis, collected in Guangdong province, formed a divergent independent branch from the other 3 strains from R. sinicus, sampled in Yunnan Province, indicating an independent evolution process associated with geographic isolation and host restrain. Though collected from same province, these three virus strains formed two genotypes correlated to sampling locations. These two genotypes had low genome sequence identity, especially in the S gene and accessory genes. Considering the remote geographic location of the host bat habitat, the host tropism, and the virus diversity, we suppose BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 may have spread in these two provinces with a long history of circulation in their natural reservoir, Rhinolophus bats.',\n",

Third, accessory gene ORF9 showed homology with those of other known CoV species in another coronavirus genus, especially with accessory genes from SARSr-CoV.Accessory genes are usually involved in virus-host interactions during CoV infection  . In most CoVs, accessory genes are dispensable for virus replication. However, an intact 3c gene of feline CoV was required for viral replication in the gut    .

Interestingly, BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 and SARSr-CoV were both detected in R. sinicus from the same cave. We suppose that SARS-CoV and BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 may have acquired ORF7a or ORF9 from a common ancestor through genome recombination or horizontal gene transfer. Whereas, ORF9 of BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 failed to induce apoptosis or activate NF-κB production, these differences may be induced by the divergent evolution of these proteins in different pressure.Though different BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 ORF4a share <64.4% amino acid identity, all of them could activate IFN-β. ORF3a from RsYN1 and RaGD upregulated NF-κB, but the homologue from RsYN2 downregulated NF-κB expression.',\n",
       "  \"These differences may be caused by amino acid sequence variations and may contribute to a viruses' pathogenicity with a different pathway.Though lacking of intestinal cell lines from the natural host of BtCoV/Rh/YN2012, we screened the cell tropism of their spike protein through pseudotyped retrovirus entry with human, bat and other mammalian cell lines. Most of cell lines screened were unsusceptible to BtCoV/Rh/YN2012, indicating a low risk of interspecies transmission to human and other animals. Multiple reasons may lead to failed infection of coronavirus spike-pseudotyped retrovirus system, including receptor absence in target cells, failed recognition to the receptor homologue from non-host species, maladaptation in non-host cells during the spike maturation or virus entry, or the limitation of retrovirus system in stimulating coronavirus entry. The weak infectivity of RsYN1 pseudotyped retrovirus in Huh-7 cells could be explained by the binding of spike protein to polysaccharide secreted to the surface.\",\n",

Coincidently, the two highly pathogenic agents, SARS-CoV and Rh-BatCoV HKU2 both originated from Rhinolophus bats. Considering the diversity of CoVs carried by this bat genus and their wide geographical distribution, there may be a low risk of spillover of these viruses to other animals and humans.

       " ['INTRODUCTION: Since 2008, severe cases of emerging human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) in immunocompetent adults have been reported sporadically in China. The clinical features and outcomes of the most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center observational study of pneumonia with ARDS in immunocompetent adults admitted to our respiratory ICU. We prospectively collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, sequential tests of viral load in respiratory tract and blood, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: The results for a total of five consecutive patients with severe ARDS with confirmed HAdV-55 infection were included. All five patients were immunocompetent young men with a median age of 32 years. The mean time from onset to dyspnea was 5 days. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia.',\n",
       "  'Mean partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen was 58.1. Mean durations from onset to a single-lobe consolidation shown on chest X-rays (CXRs) and, from the first positive CXR to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates, were 2 days and 4.8 days, respectively. The viral load was higher than 1 × 10(8) copies in three patients and was 1 × 10(4) in one patient. It was negative in the only patient who survived. The mean duration for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) failure and IMV failure were 30.8 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. Four patients received venovenous ECMO. Four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men. Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS.',\n",

Registered 20 April 2012Text: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are notorious pathogens in people with compromised immune function and a frequent cause of outbreaks of acute respiratory disease among young children. Life-threatening adenoviral pneumonia has previously been documented among military trainees, patients with AIDS and transplant recipients      . Human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55), which is emerging as a highly virulent pathogen for acute fatal adenoviral pneumonia among immunocompetent adults in China, has gained increasing attention  . HAdV-55 is a newly identified, emergent acute respiratory disease pathogen causing two recent outbreaks in China in 2006  and in Singapore in 2005  . In 2011, this pathogen apparently re-emerged in Beijing, China, causing several cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia  .',\n",
       "  'This pathogen was fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing  . Comparative studies showed that the ability of HAdV to cause severe disease may relate to the serotypes of HAdVs. Severe adenoviral pneumonia induced by HAdV-55 has been reported to be more closely related to severe cases compared to other serotypes (HAdV-3, HAdV-7 and HAdV-14)  .Current knowledge of HAdV-55-induced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in immunocompetent adults is derived from single case reports or relatively small, single-center series. As a result, little information is available on HAdV-55 pneumonia complicated with severe ARDS, the frequency of which is expected to increase in the coming years. Here we describe the clinical features and outcomes of five prospective cases of HAdV-55 pneumonia complicated with severe ARDS in immunocompetent adults in our ICU.Beginning in May 2012, a randomized trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in ARDS patients was carried out in our center (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01585922).',\n",

Three patients were examined by highresolution computed tomography (HRCT). Unilateral or bilateral consolidations and infiltrates were found on HRCT scans of all three of these patients. Consolidations within a single lobe or several lobes with a clear border and air bronchogram were the most common findings on HRCT scans.

Virus DNA copies in ETAs were determined for all patients during their ICU stay. The viral load was higher than 1 × 10 8 copies in three patients and 1 × 10 4 in one patient. The viral load became negative in the only patient who survived.

Table 4 gives the oxygenation data of patients before and after venovenous ECMO support.All patients received antiviral therapy, including acyclovir (10 mg/kg, every 8 hours, intravenous drip), ganciclovir (5 mg/kg, every 12 hours, intravenous drip) and ribavirin (250 mg, twice daily, intravenous drip). Considering that bacterial coinfection may combine with a severe viral infection, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were given to all patients.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cohort observational study on the clinical characteristics of patients with severe ARDS caused by emergent HAdV-55 infection and also the first on the evaluation of a viral load test for monitoring the reaction to therapy and for prediction of patient outcome. The following are the main findings of this study. (1) HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men with blood type B. All of our patients were from the same city of Hebei province, northern China. (2) Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates at the same time, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of severe HAdV-55induced ARDS.',\n",
       "  '(3) Viral load monitoring may help predict disease severity and patient outcome. (4) The NPPV and IMV failure rates were very high, and ECMO may be the last support method for this group of patients. (5) HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS has a very high mortality rate (80%) despite appropriate respiratory support.Sporadic severe adenoviral infection in healthy adults has historically been described for serotype 4  , serotype 7 [4, 12] and, more recently, serotype 14 in the general population and in military trainees [13, 14] . HAdV-55 was first completely characterized in Shaanxi, China  and then reemerged in Hebei, a province close to Beijing, where it caused several cases of acute respiratory disease  . It was presumed that HAdV-55 was a recombinant form of the B2 species of HAdV-14 and HAdV-11 [7, 15] due to its sharing a hexon gene with the HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 chassis  .',\n",
       "  'The results of our study show that HAdV-55, as an emerging pathogen among immunocompetent adults, may cause severe ARDS.The prevalence of severe fatal adenoviral pneumonia induced by HAdV-55 in our study is somewhat similar to that described by Cao and colleagues  . All cases of reported HAdV-55 in our study were from the same city: Baoding, Hebei province, northern China. They occurred between April and July 2013, just partly overlapping or following the influenza epidemic. The patients with severe disease also came from the same region and were treated during a similar time period, which suggests that HAdV-55 may be an important viral pathogen derived from this region.Our study results suggest that the following may be clinical features of ARDS caused by HAdV-55: persistent high fever, rapid progression of dyspnea, need for mechanical ventilation support, elevated AST level and rapid progression from unilateral infiltrates to bilateral consolidations.',\n",
       "  'These clinical features are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by other types of HAdV described in previous reports [6, 9] .Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host  . Chen et al. reported that, in the acute phase of HAdV-55 infection, patients with severe disease may have high levels of dendritic cells and Th17 cells  . In our study, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. Three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. Our results suggest that these three patients may have been relatively immunocompromised and that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for HAdV-55 infection in young adults. HAdV-55 DNA was previously reported in 41.2% of patients with severe infection  . In our study, HAdV-55 DNA was detected and monitored in all patients with severe ARDS.',\n",
       "  'The initial, and trend of, viral load that presented as HAdV-55 DNA copies in the respiratory tract samples and blood may suggest the severity of infection and may predict both the reaction to therapy and patient outcome.The use of mechanical ventilation and ECMO in patients with ARDS caused by HAdV-55 has not been detailed in previous studies. In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation. For patients with severe ARDS, ECMO should be considered a better choice for oxygenation.Our study has limitations.',\n",
       "  'It is an observational study with no comparison group, so the difference between the severe and modest infections could not be clarified in terms of immune status, clinical features, radiological findings, viral load and treatment effects on respiratory support and antiviral therapy. Sequential dynamic analysis is needed to determine the relationship between HAdV-55 viremia and treatment response.'],\n",
       " ['Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the ‘convergence model’ was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk.',\n",
       "  \"The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.Text: Two decades after the Institute of Medicine's seminal report  recognized novel and reemerging diseases as a new category of microbial threats, the perpetual and unexpected nature of the emergence of infectious diseases remains a challenge in spite of significant clinical and biomedical research advances  .\",\n",
       "  'Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (subtype H5N1) is the most significant newly emerging pandemic disease since HIV/AIDS. Its eruption in Southeast Asia in 2003-4 and subsequent spread globally to more than 60 countries fits the complex systems definition of \"surprise\"  . In this same year that IOM had published its final report on microbial threats which highlighted H5N1\\'s successful containment in Hong Kong in 1997  , massive outbreaks occurred in Southeast Asia where it remains endemic, along with Egypt\\'s Nile Delta. Since 2003, HPAI H5N1 has killed millions of poultry in countries throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa, and 402 humans have died from it in sixteen countries according to WHO data as of January 2015. The threat of a pandemic resulting in millions of human cases worldwide remains a possibility  .Lederberg et al. first pointed to the multiplicity of factors driving disease emergence, which later were elaborated and described in terms of \\'the convergence model\\'  .',\n",
       "  'The model proposes emergence events are precipitated by the intensifying of biological, environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic drivers. Microbial \"adaptation and change,\" along with \"changing ecosystems\" and \"economic development and land use\" form major themes. Joshua Lederberg, the major intellectual force behind the studies summed-up saying \"Ecological instabilities arise from the ways we alter the physical and biological environment, the microbial and animal tenants (humans included) of these environments, and our interactions (including hygienic and therapeutic interventions) with the parasites\"  .Combining such disparate factors and associated concepts from biomedicine, ecology, and social sciences in a single framework remains elusive. One approach suggested has been to employ social-ecological systems theory that attempts to capture the behavior of so-called \\'coupled natural-human systems\\', including the inevitable unexpected appearance of new diseases, themselves one of the \"emerging properties\" of complex adaptive systems (CAS) [7, 8] .',\n",
       "  'The convergence model can be so adapted by incorporating the dynamics of urban, agricultural, and natural ecosystem transformations proposed with this framework. These associated multifaceted interactions including feedbacks that affect ecological communities, hosts and pathogen populations, are the proximate drivers of disease emergence.The initial HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam represent an ideal opportunity to adapt and test a CAS-convergence model. Emergence risk should be highest in the most rapidly transforming urban areas, peri-urban zones where mixes of urban-rural, modern-traditional land uses and poultry husbandry coincide most intensely. Specifically we hypothesized a positive association between the presence of HPAI outbreaks in poultry at the commune level and: 1) peri-urban areas, as defined by Saksena et al. , 2) land-use diversity, and 3) co-location of intensive and extensive systems of poultry.We used the presence or absence at the commune level of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry as the dependent variable.',\n",
       "  'Vietnam experienced its first HPAI H5N1 outbreak in late 2003, since then, there have been five waves and sporadic outbreaks recorded over the years [10, 11] . We chose to study the first wave (Wave 1) that ended in February 2004 and the second wave (Wave 2) that occurred between December 2004 and April 2005. We used data from the Viet Nam 2006 Agricultural Census to develop an urbanicity classification that used data collected at a single point in time (2006) but across space (10,820 communes) to infer processes of change (urbanization, land-use diversification, and poultry intensification)  . The 58 provinces in Vietnam (not counting the 5 urban provinces that are governed centrally) are divided into rural districts, provincial towns, and provincial cities. Rural districts are further divided into communes (rural areas) and towns, and provincial towns and cities are divided into wards (urban subdistricts) and communes.',\n",
       "  'A commune in Viet Nam is thus the third level administrative subdivision, consisting of villages/hamlets. For the purpose of simplicity we will henceforth use the term \"commune\" to refer to the smallest administrative unit whether it is a commune, town, or ward. We included risk factors documented in previous work. We also aimed to understand the differences, if any, in risk dynamics at different scales; comparing risks at the national scale to those at two sub-national agro-ecological zones. For this purpose we chose to study the Red River and Mekong River deltas, well known hot spots of the disease. Hence we conducted two sets of analyses (waves 1 and 2) for three places (nation, Red River Delta, and Mekong Delta) producing a total of 6 wave-place analyses. Data on outbreaks were obtained from the publicly available database of Viet Nam\\'s Department of Animal Health.',\n",
       "  \"Given the highly complex dynamics of the epidemics and in keeping with recent methodological trends, we used multiple modeling approaches-parametric and non-parametric-with a focus on spatial analysis. We used both 'place' oriented models that can take into account variations in factors such as policies and administration as well as 'space' oriented models that recognize the importance of physical proximity in natural phenomenon  .Very few empirical studies have attempted to determine whether urbanization is related to EID outbreaks or whether urbanization is associated primarily with other factors related to EID outbreaks. One immediate problem researchers face is defining what is rural, urban, and transitional (i.e., peri-urban). Some studies have used official administrative definitions of urban and rural areas, but this approach is limited in its bluntness  . Other studies prioritized human population density as a satisfactory surrogate [11,        , but this approach ignores the important fact that density is not a risk factor if it is accompanied by sufficient infrastructure to handle the population.\",\n",
       "  'Spencer  examined urbanization as a non-linear characteristic, using household-level variables such as water and sanitation services. He found evidence that increased diversity in water supply sources and sanitation infrastructure were associated with higher incidences of HPAI. These studies employed a limited definition of urbanization that lacked a well-defined characterization of peri-urbanization.Still other studies have mapped the relative urban nature of a place, a broad concept that is often referred to as \\'urbanicity\\'     . While these studies show differences in the rural/ urban nature of communities across space and time, they have been limited to small-to medium-scale observational studies; and they have failed to distinguish between different levels of \"ruralness\". Perhaps the best known model of peri-urbanization is McGee\\'s concept of desakota (Indonesian for \"village-town\")  .',\n",
       "  'McGee identified six characteristics of desakota regions: 1) a large population of smallholder cultivators; 2) an increase in non-agricultural activities; 3) extreme fluidity and mobility of population; 4) a mixture of land uses, agriculture, cottage industries, suburban development; 5) increased participation of the female labor force; and 6) \"grey-zones\", where informal and illegal activities group  . Saksena et al. built on McGee\\'s desakota concepts and data from the 2006 Viet Nam Agricultural Census to establish an urbanicity classification. That study identified and mapped the 10,820 communes, the smallest administrative unit for which data are collected, as being rural, peri-urban, urban, or urban core. This project used the Saksena classification to assess associations between urbanicity classes, other risks factors, and HPAI outbreaks.Researchers have estimated that almost 75% of zoonotic diseases are associated with landcover and land-use changes (LCLUC) [27, 28] .',\n",
       "  \"LCLUC such as peri-urbanization and agricultural diversification frequently result in more diverse and fragmented landscapes (number of land covers or land uses per unit of land). The importance of landscape pattern, including diversity and associated processes, which equate to host species' habitat size and distribution, and thus pathogen transmission dynamics is axiomatic though the specific mechanisms depend on the disease [29, 30] . Landscape fragmentation produces ecotones, defined as abrupt edges or transitions zones between different ecological systems, thought to facilitate disease emergence by increasing the intensity and frequency of contact between host species  Furthermore, fragmentation of natural habitat tends to interrupt and degrade natural processes, including interspecies interactions that regulate densities of otherwise opportunistic species that may serve as competent hosts  , although it is not clear if reduced species diversity necessarily increases pathogen transmission  .\",\n",
       "  'Rarely has research connected land-use diversification to final health endpoints in humans or livestock; this study attempts to link land-use diversity with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks.Human populations in the rapidly urbanizing cities of the developing world require access to vegetables, fruits, meat, etc. typically produced elsewhere. As theorized by von Thünen in 1826  , much of this demand is met by farms near cities  , many in areas undergoing processes of peri-urbanization  . Due to the globalization of poultry trade, large-scale chicken farms raising thousands of birds have expanded rapidly in Southeast Asia and compete with existing small backyard farmers  . Large, enterprise-scale (15,000-100,000 birds) operations are still rare in Viet Nam (only 33 communes have such a facility). On the other hand, domestic and multinational companies frequently contract farmers to raise between 2,000 and 15,000 birds.Recent studies have examined the relative role of extensive (backyard) systems and intensive systems [15,    37] .',\n",
       "  'In much of Asia there is often a mix of commercial and backyard farming at any one location  . Experts have suggested that from a biosecurity perspective the co-location of extensive and intensive systems is a potential risk factor  . Intensive systems allow for virus evolution (e.g. Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza to HPAI) and transformation, while extensive systems allow for environmental persistence and circulation  . Previous studies of chicken populations as a risk factor have distinguished between production systems-native chickens, backyard chickens; flock density; commercial chickens, broilers and layers density, etc. [15,    37] . In isolation, however, none of these number and/or density based poultry metrics adequately measures the extent of co-location of intensive and extensive systems in any given place. Intensive and extensive systems in Viet Nam have their own fairly well defined flock sizes.',\n",
       "  'A diversity index of the relative number of intensive and extensive systems of poultry-raising can better estimate the effect of such co-location; this study attempts to link a livestock diversity index with the presence or absence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks at the commune level.This study investigated for the 10,820 communes of Viet Nam a wide suite of socio-economic, agricultural, climatic and ecological variables relevant to poultry management and the transmission and persistence of the HPAI virus. Many of these variables were identified based on earlier studies of HPAI (as reviewed in Gilbert and Pfeiffer  ). Three novel variables were included based on hypotheses generated by this project. All variables were measured or aggregated to the commune level. The novel variables were:• Degree of urbanization: We used the urbanicity classification developed by Saksena et al. to define the urban character of each commune.',\n",
       "  'The classification framework is based on four characteristics: 1) percentage of households whose main income is from agriculture, aquaculture and forestry, 2) percentage of households with modern forms of toilets, 3) percentage of land under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry and 4) the Normalized Differentiated Vegetation Index (NDVI). The three-way classification enabled testing for non-linear and non-monotonous responses.• Land-use diversity: We measured land-use diversity using the Gini-Simpson Diversity Index  . The Gini-Simpson Diversity Index is given by 1-λ, where λ equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type. In situations with only one class (complete homogeneity) the Gini-Simpson index would have a value equal to zero. Such diversity indices have been used to measure land-use diversity  . We used the following five land-use classes: annual crops, perennial crops, forests, aquaculture and built-up land (including miscellaneous uses) for which data were collected in the 2006 Agricultural Census.',\n",
       "  'The area under the last class was calculated as the difference between the total area and the sum of the first four classes. The following variables are listed according to their role in disease introduction, transmission and persistence, though some of these factors may have multiple roles.• Human population related transmission.Human population density [11, 14-16, 18, 19, 44, 45] .• Poultry trade and market.Towns and cities were assumed to be active trading places [10, 18, 37, 44, 46] . So, the distance to the nearest town/city was used as indicator of poultry trade.Trade is facilitated by access to transportation infrastructure [37, 47, 48] .',\n",
       "  'So, the distance to the nearest a) national highway and b) provincial highway was used as indicator of transportation infrastructure.• Disease introduction and amplification.The densities of chicken were calculated based on commune area [15, 19, 37, 49] .• Intermediate hosts.Duck and geese densities were calculated using total commune area [11, 19, 49] .As previous studies have shown a link between scavenging in rice fields by ducks and outbreaks, we also calculated duck density using only the area under rice.• Agro-ecological and environmental risk factors.Previous studies have shown that the extent of rice cultivation is a risk factor, mainly due its association with free ranging ducks acting as scavengers  . We used percentage of land under rice cultivation as a measure of extent.Rice cropping intensity is also a known risk factor [11, 17, 37] .',\n",
       "  'We used the mean number of rice crops per year as a measure of intensity.The extent of aquaculture is a known risk factor  , possibly because water bodies offer routes for transmission and persistence of the virus. The percentage of land under aquaculture was used as a metric.Proximity to water bodies increases the risk of outbreaks [47,    , possibly by increasing the chance of contact between wild water birds and domestic poultry. We measured the distance between the commune and the nearest: a) lake and b) river.Climatic variables-annual mean temperature and annual precipitation-have been associated with significant changes in risk [48, 53] .Elevation, which is associated with types of land cover and agriculture, has been shown to be a significant risk factor in Vietnam  .Compound Topographical Index (CTI, also known as Topographical Wetness Index) is a measure of the tendency for water to pool.',\n",
       "  'Studies in Thailand and elsewhere  have shown that the extent of surface water is a strong risk factor, possibly due to the role of water in long-range transmission and persistence of the virus. In the absence of reliable and inexpensive data on the extent of surface water we used CTI as a proxy. CTI has been used in Ecological Niche Models (ENM) of HPAI H5N1 [55, 56] . However, given the nature of ENM studies, the effect of CTI as a risk factor has been unknown so far. CTI has been used as a risk factor in the study of other infectious and non-infectious diseases  . Some studies have shown that at local scales, the slope of the terrain (a component of CTI) was significantly correlated with reservoir species dominance  . CTI is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction.',\n",
       "  'CTI is computed as follows: CTI = ln (A s / (tan (β)) where; A s = Area Value calculated as ((flow accumulation + 1) Ã (pixel area in m 2 )) and β is the slope expressed in radians  .Though previous studies have indicated that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a risk factor [10, 20, 55, 60, 61], we did not include it explicitly in our models, as the urban classification index we used included NDVI  .We obtained commune level data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks from the publicly available database of the Department of Animal Health  . Viet Nam experienced its first major epidemic waves between December 2003 and February 2006  . We chose to study the first wave (Wave 1) that ended in February 2004 and the second wave (Wave 2) that occurred between December 2004 and April 2005.',\n",
       "  \"In Wave 1, 21% of the communes and in Wave 2, 6% of the communes experienced outbreaks. We used data from the 1999 Population Census of Viet Nam to estimate human population per commune. We relied on data from two Agriculture Censuses of Viet Nam. This survey is conducted every five years covering all rural households and those peri-urban households that own farms. Thus about three-fourths of all of the country's households are included. The contents of the survey include number of households in major production activities, population, labor classified by sex, age, qualification, employment and major income source; agriculture, forestry and aquaculture land used by households classified by source, type, cultivation area for by crop type; and farming equipment by purpose. Commune level surveys include information on rural infrastructure, namely electricity, transportation, medical stations, schools; fresh water source, communication, markets, etc. Detailed economic data are collected for large farms.\",\n",
       "  'We used the 2006 Agriculture Census for most variables because the first three epidemic waves occurred between the Agricultural Censuses of 2001 and 2006 but were closer in time to the 2006 census  . However, for data on poultry numbers we used the 2001 Agriculture Census data set because between 1991 and 2003 the poultry population grew at an average rate of 7% annually. However, in 2004, after the first wave of the H5N1 epidemic, the poultry population fell 15%. Only by mid-2008 did the poultry population return close to pre-epidemic levels. Thus, we considered the poultry population data from the 2001 census to be more representative. We aggregated census household data to the commune level. A three-way classification of the rural-to-urban transition was based on a related study  .Raster data on annual mean temperature and precipitation were obtained from the World-Clim database and converted to commune level data.',\n",
       "  'The bioclimatic variables were compiled from the monthly temperature and precipitation values and interpolated to surfaces at 90m spatial resolution  . This public database provides data on the average climatic conditions of the period 1950-2000.Elevation was generated from SRTM 90 meter Digital Elevation Models (DEM) acquired from the Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI). Compound Topographical Index (CTI) data were generated using the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox for Arc-GIS 10.1.Prior to risk factor analysis we cleaned the data by identifying illogical values for all variables and then either assigning a missing value to them or adjusting the values. Illogical values occurred mainly (less than 1% of the cases) for land-related variables such as percentage of commune land under a particular type of land use. Next we tested each variable for normality using the BestFit software (Palisade Corporation). Most of the variables were found to follow a log-normal distribution and a log-transform was used on them.',\n",
       "  'We then examined the bi-variate correlations between all the risk factors (or their log-transform, as the case may be). Correlations were analyzed separately for each place. Certain risk factors were then eliminated from consideration when |r| ! 0.5 (r is the Pearson correlation coefficient). When two risk factors were highly correlated, we chose to include the one which had not been adequately studied explicitly in previously published risk models. Notably, we excluded a) elevation (correlated with human population density, chicken density, duck density, percentage land under paddy, annual temperature and compound topographical index), b) human population density (correlated with elevation and CTI), c) chicken density (only at national level, correlated with CTI), d) duck and goose density (correlated with elevation, chicken density, percentage land under paddy, land use diversity index and CTI), e) annual temperature (correlated with elevation and CTI) and f) cropping intensity (correlated with percentage land under paddy).Considering the importance of spatial autocorrelation in such epidemics, we used two modeling approaches: 1) multi-level Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and 2) Boosted Regression trees (BRT) [63, 64] with an autoregressive term  .',\n",
       "  \"GLMM is a 'place' oriented approach that is well suited to analyzing the effect of administrative groupings, while BRT is a 'space' oriented approach that accounts for the effects of physical proximity. We began by deriving an autoregressive term by averaging the presence/absence among a set of neighbors defined by the limit of autocorrelation, weighted by the inverse of the Euclidean distance  .The limit of the autocorrelation of the response variable was obtained from the range of the spatial correlogram ρ (h)  . To determine which predictor variables to include in the two models, we conducted logistic regression modeling separately for each of them one by one but included the autoregressive term each time. We finally included only those variables whose coefficient had a significance value p 0.2 (in at least one wave-place combination) and we noted the sign of the coefficient.\",\n",
       "  'This choice of p value for screening risk factors is common in similar studies [15, 18, 45, 67] . We used a two-level GLMM (communes nested under districts) to take account of random effects for an area influenced by its neighbors, and thus, we studied the effect of spatial autocorrelation. We used robust standard errors for tests of fixed effects. Boosted regression trees, also known as stochastic gradient boosting, was performed to predict the probability of HPAI H5N1 occurrence and determine the relative influence of each risk factor to the HPAI H5N1 occurrence. This method was developed recently and applied widely for distribution prediction in various fields of ecology [63, 64] . It is widely used for species distribution modeling where only the sites of occurrence of the species are known  . The method has been applied in numerous studies for predicting the distribution of HPAI H5N1 disease [16, 51,    .',\n",
       "  'BRT utilizes regression trees and boosting algorithms to fit several models and combines them for improving prediction by performing iterative loop throughout the model [63, 64] .The advantage of BRT is that it applies stochastic processes that include probabilistic components to improve predictive performance. We used regression trees to select relevant predictor variables and boosting to improve accuracy in a single tree. The sequential process allows trees to be fitted iteratively through a forward stage-wise procedure in the boosting model. Two important parameters specified in the BRT model are learning rate (lr) and tree complexity (tc) to determine the number of trees for optimal prediction [63, 64] . In our model we used 10 sets of training and test points for cross-validation, a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0.01, and a bag fraction of 0.5. Other advantages of BRT include its insensitivity to co-linearity and non-linear responses.',\n",
       "  'However, for the sake of consistency with the GLMM method, we chose to eliminate predictors that were highly correlated with other predictors and to make log-transforms where needed. In the GLMM models we used p 0.05 to identify significant risk factors.The predictive performances of the models were assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve. AUC is a measure of the overall fit of the model that varies from 0.5 (chance event) to 1.0 (perfect fit)  . A comparison of AUC with other accuracy metrics concluded that it is the most robust measure of model performance because it remained constant over a wide range of prevalence rates  . We used the corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) to compare each GLMM model with and without its respective suite of fixed predictors.We used SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., New York, 2012) for GLMM and R version 3.1.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2014) for the BRT.',\n",
       "  'For calculating the spatial correlogram we used the spdep package of R.The fourteen predictor variables we modeled (see tables) were all found to be significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks (p 0.2) in at least one wave-place combination based on univariate analysis (but including the autoregressive term) ( Table 1) . Land-use diversity, chicken density, poultry flock size diversity and distance to national highway were found to have significant associations across five of the six wave-place combinations.power of the GLMM models, as measured by the AUC, is very good with AUC values ranging from 0.802 to 0.952 (Tables 2-7 ). The predictive power of the national models was higher than that of the delta models. The predictive power of the BRT models is good, with AUCs ranging from 0.737 to 0.914. The BRT models also had a better predictive power at the national level than at the delta level.',\n",

Both Gilbert et al. and this study found that at the national level the predictive performance for Wave 2 was higher than that for Wave 1. Wave 2 mainly affected the Mekong River Delta. Previous studies indicated the duck density was an important predictor  ; our results, however, indicated that the diversity of duck flock size was a more important predictor than duck density.Both the GLMM and BRT models found annual precipitation to be a significant factor. The GLMM model indicated a negative association; similar to what was found by studies in China  and in the Red River Delta  . A global study of human cases also found occurrence to be higher under drier conditions  .',\n",
       "  'Generally, the role of precipitation was found to be far more significant in the deltas than for the country as a whole.The unadjusted Relative Risk (RR) of peri-urban areas in comparison with non-peri-urban areas was 1.41 and 1.60 for Waves 1 and 2, respectively. In terms of urbanicity, we found that chicken density, percentage of land under rice, percentage of land under aquaculture, flock size diversity for duck and geese, and the Compound Topographical Index (CTI) to be highest in peri-urban areas (Fig 1a-1e) . We also found that land-use diversity was higher in rural areas, but peri-urban areas had diversity levels only marginally lower (Fig 1f) . The urbanicity variable alone, however, was not found to be significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 in any place according to the GLMM model except for the urban level in Red River Delta for Wave 2 and in the Mekong River Delta for Wave 1.',\n",
       "  'The BRT model ranked urbanicity as one of the least influential variables. Land-use diversity was found to be significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 in both waves for Viet Nam according to the GLMM model, but at the delta level the association was significant only for Wave 2 in the Mekong River Delta. The BRT model indicated that land-use diversity highly influenced HPAI H5N1 at the national level in Wave 2. For the remaining waveplace combinations land-use diversity had middle to below-middle rank of influence.Both the GLMM and BRT models indicated that the diversity of chicken flock-size had a strong association with HPAI H5N1 for both waves at the national level. This was generally found to be true at the delta levels with some exceptions.',\n",
       "  'The diversity of duck and goose flock size was also significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 in all places, but the associations were much stronger in Wave 2 than in Wave 1.The GLMM model indicated that the CTI had a very strong association with HPAI H5N1 at the national level in both waves although this was not true in the two deltas. The CTI is a steady state wetness index commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes. Accumulation numbers in flat areas, like deltas, are very large; hence the CTI was not a relevant variable in the GLMM model in these areas. The BRT model however indicated that CTI had middle to low influence in all waves and places. We found very high spatial clustering effects as indicated by the fact that in all waves and places the BRT model found the spatial autocorrelation term to have the highest rank of influence.',\n",
       "  'As expected, the relative influence of the autocorrelation term at the national level was higher (60-78%) than at the delta levels (14-35%). In the GLMM models we found the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using the entire set of 14 variables to be much lower than the AICs of a GLMM model without fixed effects. This indicated that though clustering effects were significant, our theory driven predictor variables improved model performance.A limitation of using surveillance methods for the dependent variable (poultry outbreaks) is that the data may have reporting/detection biases  . Under-reporting/detection in rural areas as compared to peri-urban areas is possible. We believe that the urbanicity and the shortest distance to nearest town risk factors serve as rough proxies for reporting/detection efficiency. Previous studies have tended to use human population density as a proxy for this purpose. In our study we found a strong association between human population density and urbanicity.',\n",
       "  \"But we acknowledge that a categorical variable such as urbanicity may provide less sensitivity than a continuous variable such as human population density in this specific context.This study explored the validity of a general model for disease emergence that combined the IOM 'convergence model'  and the social-ecological systems model [7, 8] , for investigating the specific case of HPAI in Vietnam. We sought to test the hypotheses that measures of urbanization, land-use diversification, and poultry intensification are correlated with outbreaks in poultry. Our results generally support the hypothesis that social-ecological system transformations are associated with H5NI outbreaks in poultry.The results presented here highlight three main findings: 1) when relevant risk factors are taken into account, urbanization is generally not a significant independent risk factor; but in peri-urban landscapes emergence factors converge, including higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture; 2) high land-use diversity landscapes, a variable not previously considered in spatial studies of HPAI H5N1, are at significantly greater risk for HPAI H5N1 outbreaks; as are 3) landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production are co-located.Only one other study has explicitly examined urbanicity in the context of HPAI H5N1.\",\n",
       "  'Loth et al. found peri-urban areas in Indonesia were significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 cases, even based on multivariate models. Our study, however, attempted both to associate HPAI H5N1 with degree of urbanicity and to determine the features of peri-urban areas that place them at risk. When those features (i.e., chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and the fraction of land under rice or aquaculture) are included in multivariate models, the role of the urbanization variable per se diminishes. We found in the main river deltas in Viet Nam (Red River and Mekong), urbanization had no significant association with HPAI H5N1. This may be due to the fact that the deltas are more homogenous, in terms of urbanization, than the country as a whole. This is the first study to examine land-use diversity as a risk factor for HPAI H5N1.',\n",
       "  'Measured by the Gini-Simpson Diversity Index of the five land-use classes on which data were collected in the 2006 Viet Nam Agricultural Census, and the presence or absence of HPAI outbreaks at the commune level, our results indicate a strong association between land-use diversity and HPAI H5N1 at the national level and in the Mekong River Delta. This metric captures both the variety of habitats and of the complexity of geospatial patterning likely associated with transmission intensity. Our results are similar to what has been observed by studies of other EIDs using fragmentation metrics (e.g.    . This is one of the few studies, however, to link landscape fragmentation to an EID disease in poultry and not just to the vector and/or hosts of the EID.Previous studies have focused on poultry production factors such as type of species, size of flocks, and extent of commercialization (e.g. [15,    .',\n",
       "  'This study expands on those findings by providing evidence that when intensive and extensive systems of chicken and/or duck and geese production co-exist in the same commune, the commune experiences higher risk of disease outbreak. Future studies need to examine the biological causal mechanisms in this context.We suggest that national census data (particularly agricultural censuses) compiled at local levels of administration provide valuable information that are not available from remotely sensed data (such as poultry densities) or require a large amount of labor to map at national to larger scales (land-use diversity). Mapping land-use classes at the national scale for local administrative units (i.e., the 10,820 communes in Viet Nam) is not an insignificant task. Future studies, however, could examine the correlation between a census-based metric with metrics derived from remote sensing used to measure proportional abundance of each landcover type within a landscape  .',\n",
       "  'Vietnam is relatively advanced in making digital national population and agricultural census data available in a format that can be linked to administrative boundaries. While other nations are beginning to develop similar capacities, in the short term the application of this method to other countries may be limited. Ultimately, both census and remotely sensed data can be used independently to map the urban transition and diversity of land use; these tools, however, may provide their greatest insights when used together.Another important contribution of this study was the discovery of the importance of CTI. So far CTI had been used only in ecological niche modeling studies of HPAI H5N1; the specific role and direction of influence of CTI had has so far been unknown. Our study, the first to use CTI as a risk factor, found it had a large positive influence on HPAI H5N1 risk at the national level.',\n",
       "  'Previous studies have highlighted the role of surface water extent in the persistence and transmission of the HPAI H5N1 virus. These studies measured surface water extent as area covered by water, magnitude of seasonal flooding, distance to the nearest body of water, or other variables that are often difficult to map using remotely sensed data, especially for large area studies. CTI on the other hand has the potential to serve as an excellent surrogate which can easily be measured in a GIS database. The national and regional (delta) models differed quite considerably, both in terms of performance and significant risk factors. In the deltas we commonly found only chicken density, duck flock size diversity and annual precipitation to be significant. This suggests dynamics of risk at the commune level are strongly dependent on the spatial range of analysis, consistent with another study in the Mekong Delta  .',\n",
       "  \"Though that study's model initially included three dozen commonly known risk factors, the significant risk factors were limited to poultry flock density, proportion households with electricity, re-scaled NDVI median May-October, buffalo density and sweet potato yield. Another study in the Red River Delta  found that in addition to the typical poultry density metrics, only the presence of poultry traders was significant. We speculate that for smaller regions, especially for known hot-spots, the relevant risk factors are those that reflect short-range, short-term driving forces such as poultry trading, presence of live bird markets and wet markets etc. Improving model performance for smaller regions would require highly refined and nuanced metrics for poultry trading, road infrastructure, water bodies, etc.-data that are typically not available through census surveys.\",\n",
       "  'The differences between the national and regional models suggest that our results can inform planners making decisions at different hierarchical levels of jurisdiction: national, region and local.Our study has the potential to inform the design of future research related to the epidemiology of other EIDs in Viet Nam and elsewhere. For example, we speculate that in Southeast Asia, Japanese encephalitis, the transmission of which is associated with rice cultivation and flood irrigation  , may also show a strong association with peri-urbanization. In some areas of Asia these ecological conditions occur near, or occasionally within, urban centers. Likewise, Hantaan virus, the cause of Korean hemorrhagic fever, is associated with the field mouse Apodemus agrarius and rice harvesting in fields where the rodents are present  . Our work has demonstrated that the percentage of land under rice in peri-urban areas and rural areas is similar.',\n",
       "  \"Hence diseases associated with rice production are likely to peak in peri-urban areas given other risk factors such as land-use diversity, CTI, and distance to infrastructure. Our poultry flock-size diversity findings may also be relevant to understanding the dynamics of other poultry related infections such as Newcastle disease. Finally, these results suggest the validity of a general model of zoonotic disease emergence that integrates IOM's convergence model with the subsequently proposed social-ecological systems and EID framework. Thus, convergence represents the coalescence in time and space of processes associated with land-cover and land-use changes. Project results question whether the urban/rural land-use dichotomy is useful when large areas and parts of the population are caught between the two. Planners need better tools for mapping the rural-urban transition, and for understanding how the specific nature of peri-urban environments creates elevated health risk that require adaptation of existing planning, land use, and development practices.\"],\n",

As of March 3, 2020, over 80,000 cases have been confirmed in China, including 2946 deaths as well as over 10,566 confirmed cases in 72 other countries. Such huge numbers of infected and dead people call for an urgent demand of effective, available, and affordable drugs to control and diminish the epidemic.We have recently reported that two drugs, remdesivir (GS-5734) and chloroquine (CQ) phosphate, efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 1 .',\n",
       "  \"Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog prodrug developed by Gilead Sciences (USA). A recent case report showed that treatment with remdesivir improved the clinical condition of the first patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the United States 2 , and a phase III clinical trial of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in Wuhan on February 4, 2020. However, as an experimental drug, remdesivir is not expected to be largely available for treating a very large number of patients in a timely manner. Therefore, of the two potential drugs, CQ appears to be the drug of choice for large-scale use due to its availability, proven safety record, and a relatively low cost. In light of the preliminary clinical data, CQ has been added to the list of trial drugs in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (sixth edition) published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.\",\n",
       "  'CQ (N4-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4pentanediamine) has long been used to treat malaria and amebiasis. However, Plasmodium falciparum developed widespread resistance to it, and with the development of new antimalarials, it has become a choice for the prophylaxis of malaria. In addition, an overdose of CQ can cause acute poisoning and death 3 . In the past years, due to infrequent utilization of CQ in clinical practice, its production and market supply was greatly reduced, at least in China. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a derivative of CQ, was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into CQ and was demonstrated to be much less (~40%) toxic than CQ in animals 4 . More importantly, HCQ is still widely available to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Since CQ and HCQ share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of acting as a weak base and immunomodulator, it is easy to conjure up the idea that HCQ may be a potent candidate to treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       "  'Actually, as of February 23, 2020, seven clinical trial registries were found in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) for using HCQ to treat COVID-19. Whether HCQ is as efficacious as CQ in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection still lacks the experimental evidence.To this end, we evaluated the antiviral effect of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to CQ in vitro.

To better compare the antiviral activity of CQ versus HCQ, the dose-response curves of the two compounds against SARS-CoV-2 were determined at four different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) by quantification of viral RNA copy numbers in the cell supernatant at 48 h post infection (p.i.). The data summarized in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S1 show that, at all MOIs (0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), the 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for CQ (2.71, 3.81, 7.14, and 7.36 μM) was lower than that of HCQ (4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 μM).\",\n",
       "  'The differences in EC 50 values were statistically significant at an MOI of 0.01 (P < 0.05) and MOI of 0.2 (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Table S1 ). It is worth noting that the EC 50 values of CQ seemed to be a little higher than that in our previous report (1.13 μM at an MOI of 0.05) 1 , which is likely due to the adaptation of the virus in cell culture that significantly increased viral infectivity upon continuous passaging. Consequently, the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ) of CQ (100.81, 71.71, 38.26, and 37.12) was higher than that of HCQ (55.32, 61.45, 14.41, 19.25) at MOIs of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8, respectively. These results were corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy as evidenced by different expression levels of virus nucleoprotein (NP) at the indicated drug concentrations at 48 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. S1 ).',\n",
       "  'Taken together, the data suggest that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HCQ seems to be less potent compared to CQ, at least at certain MOIs.Both CQ and HCQ are weak bases that are known to elevate the pH of acidic intracellular organelles, such as endosomes/lysosomes, essential for membrane fusion 5 . In addition, CQ could inhibit SARS-CoV entry through changing the glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and spike protein 6 . Time-of-addition experiment confirmed that HCQ effectively inhibited the entry step, as well as the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, which was also found upon CQ treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). To further explore the detailed mechanism of action of CQ and HCQ in inhibiting virus entry, co-localization of virions with early endosomes (EEs) or endolysosomes (ELs) was analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) and confocal microscopy. Quantification analysis showed that, at 90 min p.i.',\n",
       "  'in untreated cells, 16.2% of internalized virions (anti-NP, red) were observed in early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)-positive EEs (green), while more virions (34.3%) were transported into the late endosomal-lysosomal protein LAMP1 + ELs (green) (n > 30 cells for each group). By contrast, in the presence of CQ or HCQ, significantly more virions (35.3% for CQ and 29.2% for HCQ; P < 0.001) were detected in the EEs, while only very few virions (2.4% for CQ and 0.03% for HCQ; P < 0.001) were found to be co-localized with LAMP1 + ELs (n > 30 cells) (Fig. 1b, c) . This suggested that both CQ and HCQ blocked the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from EEs to ELs, which appears to be a requirement to release the viral genome as in the case of SARS-CoV 7 .Interestingly, we found that CQ and HCQ treatment caused noticeable changes in the number and size/morphology of EEs and ELs (Fig.',\n",
       "  '1c) . In the untreated cells, most EEs were much smaller than ELs (Fig. 1c) . In CQand HCQ-treated cells, abnormally enlarged EE vesicles were observed (Fig. 1c , arrows in the upper panels), many of which are even larger than ELs in the untreated cells. This is in agreement with previous report that treatment with CQ induced the formation of expanded cytoplasmic vesicles 8 . Within the EE vesicles, virions (red) were localized around the membrane (green) of the vesicle. CQ treatment did not cause obvious changes in the number and size of ELs; however, the regular vesicle structure seemed to be disrupted, at least partially. By contrast, in HCQ-treated cells, the size and number of ELs increased significantly (Fig. 1c , arrows in the lower panels).Since acidification is crucial for endosome maturation and function, we surmise that endosome maturation might be blocked at intermediate stages of endocytosis, resulting in failure of further transport of virions to the ultimate releasing site.',\n",

To our knowledge, there is a lack of studies on the impact of HCQ on the morphology and pH values of endosomes/ lysosomes. Our observations suggested that the mode of actions of CQ and HCQ appear to be distinct in certain aspects.It has been reported that oral absorption of CQ and HCQ in humans is very efficient. In animals, both drugs share similar tissue distribution patterns, with high concentrations in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung reaching levels of 200-700 times higher than those in the plasma 10 .

Other than its direct antiviral activity, HCQ is a safe and successful anti-inflammatory agent that has been used extensively in autoimmune diseases and can significantly decrease the production of cytokines and, in particular, pro-inflammatory factors. Therefore, in COVID-19 patients, HCQ may also contribute to attenuating the inflammatory response. In conclusion, our results show that HCQ can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In combination with its anti-inflammatory function, we predict that the drug has a good potential to combat the disease. This possibility awaits confirmation by clinical trials. We need to point out, although HCQ is less toxic than CQ, prolonged and overdose usage can still cause poisoning.',\n",

Although microtubule severing is fundamental to many dynamic neural processes, little is known regarding the role of the family member Katanin p60 subunit A-like 1, KATNAL1, in central nervous system (CNS) function. Recent studies reporting that microdeletions incorporating the KATNAL1 locus in humans result in intellectual disability and microcephaly suggest that KATNAL1 may play a prominent role in the CNS; however, such associations lack the functional data required to highlight potential mechanisms which link the gene to disease symptoms. Here we identify and characterise a mouse line carrying a loss of function allele in Katnal1. We show that mutants express behavioural deficits including in circadian rhythms, sleep, anxiety and learning/memory. Furthermore, in the brains of Katnal1 mutant mice we reveal numerous morphological abnormalities and defects in neuronal migration and morphology.',\n",

Recent evidence from genetic characterisation of human patients suggests that haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1 is linked with a number of symptoms including intellectual disability (ID) and craniofacial dysmorphologies. 8, 9 It is also notable that a very rare KATNAL1 mutation has been associated with schizophrenia 10 (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/gene book.cgi?user = guest&cmd = verb-gene&tbox = KATNAL1) and that Peters syndrome and autism have both been associated with the chromosomal region containing the KATNAL1 locus. 11, 12 Although such association studies strongly suggest that KATNAL1 plays a fundamental role in the central nervous system (CNS), additional studies using cellular or animals models are required to understand how the gene may be causative for disease.

An outcross using an affected female produced no affected animals (33 animals screened).

For full details of mapping and identification of the mutation see reference 23. This mutant allele was designated Katnal1 1H , and results in a leucine to valine substitution at residue 286 of the protein.

Therefore to complement our circadian studies we conducted wireless electroencephalography recordings over a baseline period of 24 h and following a 6 h period of sleep deprivation. A detailed summary of electroencephalography analysis is given in Supplementary Table S1. Compared to wildtype littermates, the non-REM delta power of Katnal1 1H/1H mice was higher in the dark phase of baseline sleep (mixed ANOVA, interaction factors 'genotype X time, F(1,88) = 8.91, P = 0.0175) ( Figure 1f ) and in both the light and dark phases of recovery sleep (mixed ANOVA, interaction factors 'genotype X time', F(1,136) = 11.93, P = 0.0086; Figure 1g ).\",\n",

Data and cohort details are given in Supplementary Table S2 .Both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer in Katnal1 1H/1H mice, as evidenced by reduced spontaneous alternations in a T-maze ( Figure 2a ) and in the Morris water maze where mutants take longer to find the platform in acquisition trials (Figure 2b Compared to wild-type littermates, Katnal1 1H/1H animals have a shorter period (c), are more active in the light phase of the light/dark cycle (d) and show an earlier onset of activity in light/dark transitions and in the transition from light/dark cycles to constant darkness (e).',\n",

To test whether Katnal1 1H/1H animals vocalised differently to wild types, we separated pups at postnatal days 7-8 (the age at which mice show peak of USV emission 24 ) and recorded their USVs. In these tests, compared to wild types, Katnal1 1H/1H pups produced fewer ( Figure 2g ) and shorter (Figure 2h ) vocalisations, containing fewer phrases (Figure 2i ). Gross brain morphological abnormalities in Katnal1 1H/1H mice Since we observed a number of behavioural phenotypes in Katnal1 1H/1H mice, we performed histological analysis to ascertain whether differences in brain histology underlied these behaviours. Data and cohort details are given in Supplementary Table S3 . Analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained brain sections revealed that, compared to wildtype littermates, Katnal1 1H/1H animals had less tightly packed pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampus (Figures 3a and b) and a narrower cortical layer 1 and wider cortical layer 6 (Figures 3c-e) .',\n",

At both ages Katnal1 1H/1H animals had greater numbers of labelled neurons in bins close to the cortical surface neurons positioned closer to the cortical surface compared to wild type. To confirm these results we used a Boyden chamber 19 and performed in vitro neuronal migration analysis in E13.5 primary cortical neuronal cultures.',\n",

Given its role in cytoskeletal organisation, we also hypothesised that neuronal morphology is modulated by Katnal1. Analysis of golgi stained neurons from layers 2-3 of the cortex (Figures 4g and i) demonstrated that, compared to wild-type littermates, Katnal1 1H/1H neurons had larger soma (Figure 4k) , and shorter and thinner axons (Figures 4l and m) (data and cohort details are given in Supplementary Table S3 ).',\n",

Visual inspection of the cilia identified a number of ciliary abnormalities such as a swollen ciliary tip (Supplementary Movie S3) or extremely long cilia (Supplementary Movie S4) scattered throughout the field of cilia in Katnal1 1H/1H ventricles. These abnormalities were observed in approximately 25% of Katnal1 1H/1H brain slices. The abnormal cilia always showed a dyskinetic beat pattern and lower beat frequency.

However in Katnal1 1H/1H samples we noted the presence of both long and short cilia (Figures 5e and f ; defined as two standard deviations longer or shorter than the average cilia length) that were not present in wild-type samples. In addition, inspection of Katnal1 1H/1H cilia identified ciliary abnormalities including bifurcated cilia (Figure 5g) , abnormal kinks and bends in the cilia (Figure 5h ) and swellings along the length of the cilia (Figure 5i ).

Here we present a detailed phenotypic analysis of Katnal1 1H and show that the mutation is associated with changes in circadian rhythms, sleep and behaviour. Furthermore we demonstrate that defects in brain histopathology, neuronal migration and neuronal morphology underlie these phenotypes. Finally we also demonstrate that Katnal1 1H causes a range of defects in the motile cilia of ventricular ependymal cells. The data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such dysfunctions with important implications for clinical association studies.The Katnal1 1H mutation was initially identified with a circadian deficit including a short free-running period and advanced activity onset.',\n",
       "  'However subsequent ex vivo experiments using SCN slices of animals carrying the PER2::LUC reporter gene demonstrated no defects in SCN cellular rhythms, suggesting that the core circadian clock was unperturbed by the mutation. Phenotypes in circadian running wheel rhythms that are not associated with changes to the core clock mechanism have also been reported in mouse models of schizophrenia. 25 Here it has been suggested that the wheel running changes observed are the result in defects in output pathways from the SCN circadian clock. Similarly, in Katnal1 1H/1H mice we hypothesise that the defects we demonstrate in neuronal anatomy and neuronal morphology may disrupt output signals from the SCN. Alternatively given that various neuropeptides such as oxytocin are secreted in a circadian manner from ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the brain, 26 altered ventricular morphology and ciliary function in Katnal1 1H/1H mice may disrupt the circulation of factors secreted by the ciliated ventricular ependymal cells and contribute to the disruption of the behavioural rhythms observed.The behavioural consequences of microtubule severing enzyme dysfunction in mouse models have been poorly characterised.',\n",
       "  'Currently the phenotypes described are limited to motor dysfunction in mice lacking the Spg4 gene 27 and head shaking and circling in the Fign mutant. 7, 28, 29 In contrast, here we demonstrate that loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment (the open field) and deficits in USVs. Notably the learning and memory, anxiety and vocalisation phenotypes reprise the clinical symptoms of ID, increased anxiety in novel situations and delays in language acquisition reported in human patients who carry microdeletions incorporating haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1. 8, 9 While it is also worth noting that mutant mice spend more time the centre of the open field than wild types (implying that Katnal1 1H/1H animals show reduced anxiety), we suggest that this result is confounded by the hyperactivity in novel environments phenotype we also describe in mutant mice.',\n",
       "  \"This observation is backed up by the fact that mutant animals showed increased activity in all regions of the open field rather than just the anxiolytic periphery. Here we also highlight defects in Katnal1 1H/1H mice such as compromised neuronal migration and morphology which may underpin such phenotypes. In Drosophila, the homologue of Katnal1 (kat-60L1) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in neuronal morphology during development, 30 however the data that we present here is the first to demonstrate a similar phenotype in mammals and furthermore suggests how subtle perturbations to KATNAL1 function may contribute to specific neural and behavioural conditions. For example, defects in neuronal migration, synaptic spines and neuronal morphology such as those we have demonstrated here, have been suggested to underpin ID in conditions such as lissencephaly, 18 Down's syndrome 31 and Rett syndrome.\",\n",
       "  '32 While we are not suggesting that Katnal1 is causative for these conditions, similarities in symptoms and neuronal phenotypes between these conditions and those linked to Katnal1 dysfunction should be appreciated. Furthermore a rare mutation in KATNAL1 has been associated with schizophrenia 10 (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/gene book/genebook.cgi?user = guest&cmd = verb-gene&tbox = KATNAL1) and KATNAL1 has been shown to interact with the schizophrenia associated gene DISC1. 33 In line with these observations we note that increases in ventricular volume and reductions in synaptic spines have been reported in schizophrenic patients 34, 35 and our data demonstrates the same phenotypes in Katnal1 1H/1H mice. Thus the range of phenotypes associated with defects in the function of Katnal1 strongly suggests that the gene should be considered in the pathology of disorders such as ID and schizophrenia.We do note one key genetic difference between the human patients and Katnal1 1H/1H animals.',\n",
       "  'While the human patients were all heterozygous for the Katnal1 deletion, we found no phenotype in heterozygous mutant mice (data not shown) suggesting that while haploinsufficiency is causative for phenotypes in humans, mice require complete loss of KATNAL1 function to show similar effects. A similar discrepancy between humans and mice has also been noted for the intellectual disability candidate gene CTNNB1. 17 While heterozygous loss of function mutations in CTNNB1 are causative for intellectual disability in humans, conditional knock outs for CTNNB1 have no reported behavioural or craniofacial phenotypes. 36, 37 These differences demonstrate that while mouse models of intellectual disability are of great use in our understanding of the causative mechanisms which underlie the condition, there are still genetic and neurodevelopmental differences between species which also must be taken into account. We also note that while the Katnal1 1H mutation shows a loss of catalytic function in both HEK293 cells and Sertoli cells, 23 this loss of function has not been verified in neuronal cells.',\n",
       "  'However, given that our data demonstrates that the Katnal1 1H mutation lies in an essential catalytic domain and that we show neuronal phenotypes in Katnal1 1H/1H mice, we would expect to see the same loss of catalytic function in neurons.The data we present here also demonstrate defects in motile cilia in Katnal1 1H/1H mice. Ciliary disruptions in humans (ciliopathies) include Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndrome. 38 While there is currently limited data available regarding the behavioural phenotypes of mouse models of ciliopathies, we note that ciliary dysfunction in mice has been linked with learning and memory 39 and vocalisation phenotypes, 40 both of which were disturbed in the Katnal1 1H/1H mice described here. It is also notable that the neuronal migration and enlarged ventricle phenotypes that we describe in Katnal1 1H/1H mice recapitulate features associated with known ciliopathy gene mutations.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore in Bardet-Biedl syndrome mouse models ciliary defects such as reduced CBF 45 and structural defects such as abnormal lengthening and swellings along their length 41 have been described, that are similar to those we describe in Katnal1 1H/1H mice. There is strong evidence that ciliopathy associated genes play a number of roles in neuronal development by affecting processes such as progenitor proliferation or maintenance of the radial glia scaffold. 43 However it is also clear that defects in microtubule organisation also affect synaptic structure. 2 At present it is difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of defects in microtubule severing and ciliary abnormalities to the overall phenotypes we observe in Katnal1 1H/1H mice. Further investigations are required to clarify the impacts of these two processes.',\n",
       "  'However it is notable that while defects in cilia structure may contribute to the phenotypes we describe in Katnal1 1H/1H mice, they are far less prominent in Katnal1 1H/1H mice than in other mouse ciliopathy models, 41 suggesting that the ciliary component of KATNAL1 dysfunction may be mild compared to other ciliopathies. Similarly while hydrocephalus has been suggested to be a component of some ciliopathy mouse models, 46 Katnal1 1H/1H mice showed only increased ventricle size rather than an increased incidence of hydrocephalus, further suggesting the ciliary defects in these animals are mild compared to other ciliopathies.In summary the data presented here clearly demonstrate that KATNAL1 plays an important role in a variety of neuronal processes including neuronal migration, neuronal morphology and ependymal ciliary function. The downstream effect of these defects leads in turn to a number of behavioural changes including in learning and memory, reaction to anxiogenic situations and circadian rhythms.',\n",

No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.Text: F laviviruses are taxonomically classified in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.These viruses comprise over 70 different pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV).',\n",
       "  'Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and cause public health problems worldwide (1) . The development and usage of vaccines against some flaviviruses, such as JEV, YFV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), have decreased the rates of morbidity and mortality from infections caused by these viruses (2) ; however, flavivirus-induced diseases are still pandemic, and few therapies beyond intensive supportive care are currently available.Flaviviruses have an approximately 11-kb positive-stranded RNA genome containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both termini. The ORF encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (premembrane [prM] and membrane [M] ), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (3) . These seven nonstructural proteins participate in viral replication, virion assembly, and virus escape from immune surveillance.To date, no specific antivirals with activity against flaviviruses are available.',\n",
       "  'To address this, we conducted a screen of a library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs. Since flaviviruses are similar in structure and pathogenesis, we first utilized JEV as the prototype to screen the drug library and subsequently validated the antiviral activities with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). The hit drugs identified in this study offer potential new therapies for the treatment of flavivirus infection and disease.Screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV infection. Recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon enveloped by the JEV structural proteins were used to select inhibitors, with a focus on those that inhibit virus entry and replication, by a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay (4, 5) . The number of genomic RNA copies of RVP was determined to be 8.4 ϫ 10 6 copies/ml by using a standard curve generated with plasmids carrying the infectious clone.',\n",
       "  'The HTS assay conditions, including the seeding cell density and RVP dose, were optimized to be 10,000 cells per 96-well plate and 20 l (16 copies/cell) RVP for the infective dose, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z= factor were 38,374, 2.8%, and 0.89, respectively, which demonstrated that the assay was robust and suitable for the large-scale screening of compounds.A schematic of the HTS assay is depicted in Fig. 1B . After three rounds of screening, five hits with a selective index (SI; which is equal to the 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 [/50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]) of Ͼ10 were selected. The CC 50 values of the hit drugs exhibited in Fig. 1B were similar to those previously published for diverse cell systems but determined using different toxicity assays (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .',\n",
       "  'Three of the hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were dihydropyridine (DHP) voltage-gated Ca 2ϩ channel (VGCC) antagonists, while pimecrolimus is an inhibitor of inflammatory cytokine secretion and nelfinavir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. All five drugs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV RVP infection (Fig. 1C) . To validate the antiviral effect, hit drugs were purchased from other commercial sources and tested. In the reconfirmation screen, all hit drugs showed antiviral and cytotoxic effects similar to those found in the primary screen.Validation of hit drugs. To verify the results obtained by the luciferase reporter assays, we also investigated the antiviral effect of the five hit drugs on wild-type JEV strain AT31. As expected from the HTS assay, all five drugs robustly inhibited virus production, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 5 log units at the highest concentration and an approximately 1-log-unit decrease with 2.5 M the drugs (Fig.',\n",
       "  '2B) . A sharp decrease in JEV RNA levels was also detected (Fig. 2C) . The attenuated RNA levels in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were all above 40%. In particular, in the manidipine-treated group, the inhibitory effect was at least 80% compared to that for the control, which showed a strong inhibition of viral replication. Consistent with the inhibition of virus replication and production, expression of the viral structural protein prM was hardly detectable following treatment with the drugs at the high concentration (Fig. 2D) . Overall, the results in Fig. 2 confirmed that the five hit drugs inhibited JEV infection in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.Drugs inhibit JEV infection during viral RNA synthesis. Because RVPs, which have a natural virus-like envelope on the outside and a replicon on the inside, permitted the quantification of JEV productive entry and replication, a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether the hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step.',\n",
       "  'As shown in Fig. 3B , no suppression of luciferase activity by any of the hit drugs was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection or as a virucide, suggesting that these drugs do not inhibit JEV infection either by inactivating the virus directly or by blocking JEV entry. However, these drugs exerted fully inhibitory effects when they were added at 1 h postinfection, suggesting that viral replication was the stage at which these drugs showed inhibitory activity.To confirm this suggestion, we investigated the inhibitory effects of these drugs on the JEV replicon. The highest concentration of manidipine and nelfinavir mesylate tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was adjusted to 5 M and 10 M, respectively. It was shown that all five drugs inhibited JEV RNA synthesis in a dosedependent manner, while neither drug inhibited the initial translation of replicon RNA (5, 14) (Fig.',\n",
       "  '3C) , confirming that these drugs inhibited JEV infection at the stage of replication.Hit drugs exhibit broad-spectrum antiflavivirus activity. In order to determine whether the antiviral activity of the five hit drugs extended to other flaviviruses, we explored their antiviral effect against ZIKV. Similar to the findings for JEV, the ZIKV titer was decreased by multiple log units when ZIKV was treated with a high concentration of each of the drugs (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, ZIKV exhibited a higher sensitivity to the two calcium channels inhibitors manidipine and cilnidipine than JEV, with no plaque formation being observed at 10 M. Consistent with this result, sharp decreases in the level of replication of ZIKV RNA and the level of expression of viral protein were also detected (Fig. 4A) . Notably, treatment with 5 M manidipine produced a 95% inhibition of viral replication, translation, and viral yields.',\n",
       "  'Taken together, these results indicate that the hit drugs could effectively inhibit ZIKV infection.Since these drugs exhibited their anti-JEV effects at the stage of viral replication, we further tested the effects against WNV and DENV-2 by using WNV and DENV-2 replicons. Similar to the results for JEV, a dose-dependent reduction in the level of WNV replication was observed with the drug treatments. The same phenotype was observed for DENV-2 for all drugs except nelfinavir mesylate, which showed no effect at the concentrations tested ( Fig. 4B and C). Together, these results indicate that the five hit drugs are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum antiflavivirus treatment. Antiviral effect of calcium inhibitors. Since three hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were DHP VGCC inhibitors, we asked whether other calcium antagonists could block JEV infection. To address this question, we employed four different classes of inhibitors.',\n",
       "  'Verapamil, a prototype phenylalkylamine (PAA) VGCC inhibitor (15) , exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV on both African Green monkey kidney (Vero) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells (Fig. 5) , which was consistent with the inhibitory effects of the DHP inhibitors, suggesting that calcium channels play an important role in JEV infection. Cyclosporine and 2-aminobiphenyl borate (2-APB), which inhibit the efflux of Ca 2ϩ from the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool, respectively (16) (17) (18) (19) , were also found to block JEV infection effectively. Similarly, treatment with the cell-permeant Ca 2ϩ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N=,N=-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), could also suppress JEV infection. Taken together, we concluded that intracellular Ca 2ϩ is essential for JEV infection and cytoplasmic calcium is a potent target for antiflavivirus treatment.Selection and characterization of manidipine-resistant JEV. To identify the viral target of the calcium channel inhibitor, we selected a manidipine-resistant virus by serially passaging JEV in the presence of manidipine.',\n",
       "  'Viruses from passage 20 (P20) showed robust resistance compared with the wild type (WT) (Fig. 6A ). When JEV from P20 was treated with 5 M or 10 M manidipine, the viral titer was about 10-and 100-fold higher than that of the WT, respectively. Individual virus clones were isolated, and two isolates were randomly selected and amplified. An amino acid substitution was observed in two isolated clones, resulting in a glutamine (Q)-to-arginine (R) switch at amino acid position 130 in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) of NS4B, i.e., position 2401 of the translated polyprotein in the JEV infectious cDNA clone (Fig. 6B ). Sequence alignment of NS4B indicated that Q130 was conserved in all flaviviruses except YFV, which possessed a lysine at that position (Fig. 6B) . The conserved Q130 of NS4B may account for the sensitivity of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 to manidipine, as described above (Fig.',\n",
       "  '4) , while YFV showed resistance to the drug (data not shown).To confirm that the Q130R mutation did confer manidipine resistance and to investigate the role of Q130 in NS4B function, we produced JEV clones with the Q130R, Q130K, Q130E, or Q130A mutation by introducing the desired mutations into the infectious cDNA clone and rescuing the mutant viruses. To investigate the biological properties of the mutant viruses, we first examined the growth kinetics of the rescued viruses. As shown in Fig. 6C , all mutant viruses had an accumulation of infectious virions and reached the highest titer at 60 h postinfection. Infection of the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses resulted in growth curves similar to the growth curve for the WT (Fig.',\n",
       "  '6C) , while the Q130E and Q130A mutants produced smaller amounts of viruses between 24 and 60 h. Analysis of the plaque morphology revealed that the plaques of the Q130R, Q130K, and Q130E mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT, whereas the plaques of the Q130A mutant were smaller than those of the WT.We next investigated the sensitivity of the four mutant viruses to manidipine. As shown in Fig. 6D , the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine. At a 10 M concentration, manidipine efficiently inhibited WT JEV infection and reduced the viral yields by approximately 4 log units, while the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine and the viral titer decreased less than 2 log units. The Q130A mutant virus demonstrated moderate resistance and a slightly higher Taken together, it could be concluded that Q130 not only is critical for conferring manidipine sensitivity but also is important for JEV replication.',\n",
       "  'The replacement of glutamine with basic amino acids conferred resistance to manidipine without an apparent loss of growth.In vivo efficacy of manidipine. As manidipine exhibited the strongest inhibitory activities on JEV replication as well as ZIKV infection when its activities were compared with those of the five hit drugs (Fig. 2 and 4A) , we further examined the protective effect of manidipine against JEV-induced lethality in a mouse model. As anticipated, mice in the JEV-infected vehicle-treated group started to show symptoms, including limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor, from day 5 postinfection. Within 21 days postinfection, most mice in the JEV-infected group succumbed to the infection, with the mortality rate being 73% (4 out of 15 animals survived). Manidipine treatment following JEV infection reduced the mortality rate to 20% (12 out of 15 animals survived) (Fig. 7A ).',\n",
       "  'Mice treated with manidipine alone or treated with manidipine and infected with JEV showed little abnormal behavior, similar to the findings for the mice in the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that manidipine provided effective protection against JEVinduced mortality.To further relate these protective effects to the viral load and histopathological changes in the mouse brains, the viral titer was determined and mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at day 5 and day 21 postinfection, since mice started to show symptoms of JEV infection from day 5 postinfection and most of the surviving mice had recovered at day 21. The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, manidipine treatment significantly reduced the viral load in infected mice compared to that in infected mice not receiving treatment, while no plaques formed in either the manidipine-or vehicle-treated group, and viral loads were undetectable in each group on day 21 postinfection (Fig.',\n",
       "  '7B) . As JEV was rapidly cleared from the blood after inoculation and was present in the lymphatic system during the preclinical phase, the effects of manidipine on infection of serum and the spleen were evaluated at earlier time points to detect whether the drug reduced the peripheral viral loads (20, 21) . As shown in Fig. 7C , manidipine had little effect on peripheral JEV infection, which indicated that manidipine protected the mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain. Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, vacuolar degeneration, and glial nodules, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 5 postinfection, while manidipine treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 7D) . These results indicate that the alleviation of histopathological changes was accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in the rate of mortality, further confirming the curative effects of manidipine on viral encephalitis.Among the five hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride were VGCC inhibitors.',\n",
       "  'It has been well documented in the literature that Ca 2ϩ inhibitors serve to inhibit virus infection at the stage of either entry (15, 22) or replication (18) and even at the stage of budding (23) . To this end, we first reviewed all 21 calcium inhibitors included in the current library of FDA-approved drugs and found that, in addition to the four DHP VGCC inhibitors listed in Fig. 1B , two other calcium inhibitors, i.e., flunarizine dihydrochloride and lomerizine hydrochloride, were also identified to be primary candidates with levels of inhibition of Ͼ90%. Similarly, three calcium channel antagonists, nisoldipine, felodipine, and nicardipine hydrochloride, showed levels of inhibition of 75%, 72%, and 66%, respectively, in the primary screen. Together, 9 of the 21 calcium inhibitors in the library, accounting for nearly half of the calcium inhibitors, exhibited levels of flavivirus inhibition of greater than 50%, suggesting that calcium, especially the calcium channel, is a potential antiviral target.',\n",
       "  'To address this, another type of VGCC inhibitor, verapamil, an FDA-approved drug not yet included in the drug library used in this study, was investigated. Likewise, a Ca 2ϩ chelator, BAPTA-AM, as well as the Ca 2ϩ inhibitors 2-APB and cyclosporine, targeting ER and the mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ channel, respectively, were employed to investigate the response of JEV infection to the decrease in intracellular Ca 2ϩ levels. In line with the activities of the three hit DHP VGCC inhibitor drugs, the additional Ca 2ϩ inhibitors exerted anti-JEV activity, which indicated that Ca 2ϩ is indispensable for JEV infection. Thus, Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might be utilized as effective treatments for flavivirus infection.As the hit drugs exerted full inhibitory activity when they were added posttreatment, we believe that Ca 2ϩ is important for flavivirus genome replication. Furthermore, selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that NS4B is the viral target of manidipine.',\n",
       "  'NS4B is part of the viral replication complex and is supposed to anchor the viral replicase to the ER membrane (24) . Meanwhile, the N-terminal 125amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response (25) . Notably, several structurally distinct compounds have been identified to inhibit flavivirus replication by intensively targeting the TMD of NS4B (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . It is thus conceivable that inhibitors targeting TMD of NS4B would perturb its function, leading to the suppression of viral RNA replication. In this study, the replacement of Q130 of NS4B with a basic amino acid conferred the resistance effect without suppressing JEV replication, suggesting that position 130 could tolerate a basic amino acid and that the basic amino acid might be involved in the interplay of NS4B with host proteins rather than viral proteins.Moreover, the efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were monitored in vivo, with manidipine demonstrating effective antiviral activity with favorable biocompatibility.',\n",
       "  'However, the dose used in this study was higher than the dose typically used clinically, representing one of the scenarios most commonly encountered in drug repurposing (33, 34) . As manidipine was approved for use for the long-term treatment of hypertension (35, 36) , pulse-dose treatment with manidipine over the shorter period of time required for the treatment of virus infection might be relatively safe. Moreover, use of a combination of manidipine with other Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might improve its therapeutic efficacy, reduce its toxicity, and reduce the risk of resistance development (37) (38) (39) .Besides the three VGCC inhibitors, two hit drugs, pimecrolimus and nelfinavir mesylate, showed equivalent inhibitory activities on the replication of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2. Although there has been no report on the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of infectious diseases, we showed that it had a robust effect against JEV with an SI of Ͼ32.',\n",
       "  'The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of nelfinavir mesylate achieved with an adult dose was 3 to 4 g/ml (40) , which was comparable to the IC 50 reported here. Notably, nelfinavir mesylate was confirmed to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and the replication of several other herpesviruses by interfering directly or indirectly with the later steps of virus formation, such as glycoprotein maturation or virion release, other than functioning in herpesviruses protease (41, 42) . Whether nelfinavir mesylate inhibits flavivirus by interference with the virus protease or by other off-target effects is unknown. Understanding of the mechanism of the antiflavivirus effects of these drugs might uncover novel targets of the drugs, providing further insight into the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.Above all, the findings reported here provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying flavivirus infection and offer new and promising therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses.Cells and viruses.',\n",

       "  'Applying the selected statistical analysis, a Pearson x2 Chi-square value was obtained: 16.7159, df = 1 and p <0.001, meaning that the hypothesis was corroborated, that is, the greater the degradation of the environment, the more likely it will be the search for food by wild animals in adjacent areas, or in the edge of the forest or even in the peri domiciliary region. In this sense, the possibility of contagion with other species of animals, even humans, should be considered because of the capacity of the rotavirus to be transmitted via the fecal / oral route or through direct contact with the environment. It is important to point out that the animals detected in this study are important sources of viral strains.A total of 80 stool samples were selected, reextracted and analyzed using PCR for the VP4 gene.',\n",
       "  'Eight strains (10%) were positive for VP4 gene, being 2 strains bellowed to P  genotype and 6 to P-type, according to In the present study, RVA was detected circulating in 27.5% of the animals; 36% in domestic animals and 64% in wild animals, providing a unique dataset with qRT-PCR detecting a low viral load of RVA in different species, which further correlates with the deforestation index. These data are important because there is a lack of tests for RVA diagnosis in animals, since the current methods of RVA detection does not always detect in these populations  . With the advent of real-time PCR (qPCR), there was an exponential growth, compared to conventional PCR essays, since its superior accuracy, sensitivity and specificity is remarkable, and it is Rotavirus A in wild and domestic animals possible to detect RVA in a variety of animal species using NSP3 gene  .',\n",
       "  'The sensitivity of RT-qPCR significantly improved the rate of RVA detection in clinical samples from animals and in this context, the present study proposed an interesting study metrics using virus spreading in the wild animals which inhabit forest fragments to indicate human population interventions, with the goal of preventing the virus outbreaks leveraged on the unique geographic characteristics of Brazil and its large number of species in Amazon.Currently, no data have been described in the literature regarding the RVA detection using real-time qPCR technique in a wide variety of wild animal species. However, a study by Soltan et al. conducted with horses and cattle detected RVA by RT-PCR, commercial RT-PCR and RT-qPCR in 36.7%, 51.4% and 56.9% respectively, differently from the present study that showed higher positivity for chiropterans (17.98%), canines (21.35%), birds (23.6%) and cattle (14.6%).The first description of RVA in chiroptera was recorded in feces of Eidolon helvum caught in Vihiga, Kenya  .',\n",
       "  'Afterwards, several strains of RVA were detected by different molecular techniques involving chiroptera, in several countries, including Kenya (E. helvum), China (Rhinolophus hipposideros and Aselliscus stoliczkanus), France (Myotis mystacinus), Cameroon (E. helvum) and Brazil [31,      . The present study shows the occurrence of RVA in 17.98% of the chiroptera, being among the species Carollia perspicillata (37.5%), Desmodus rotundus (28.12%), Uroderma bilobata (15.6%), Artibeus lituratus (9.37%), Artibeus Planirostus (3.12%), Diaemus iyoug and Glossophagine (3.12%).Barquez et al. reported that Desmodus rotundus is one of the three hematophagous species of the Phyllostomidae family, found throughout South America, Central America and Mexico. Of the positive chiroptera for RVA in the present study, a prevalence of 28.12% was of Desmodus rotundus. This species feeds on birds, can feed on mammals, mostly medium or large, facilitating the dissemination of viral spores among the community within the habitat, as observed in the present study.',\n",
       "  'These findings show the importance of epidemiological data on the studied species due to the lack of studies involving species of neotropical chiroptera, and it is not possible to establish comparative parameters for these animals.Regarding the circulation of RVA in canines and birds, the prevalence was 53% and 29%, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Although in the Amazon region there are records of RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG that infect birds   and RVD in migratory birds  , all were detected by RT-PCR assays differently from the present study which detected the RVA by RT-qPCR involving a variety of animal species.On the other hand, the prevalence in felines (16%) and pigs (22%) was lower, probably because there are few animals of these species in the region, as well as few creations.The study detected the presence of RVA in different species of animals both in areas near the home and in areas located in fragments of forest, characterized as forest remnants, since they were located in cities that suffered high environmental impacts due to vegetal extractivism, pasture formation for cattle breeding, exploitation of natural resources, and direct reflexes on the habitats of wild animals that can serve as virus sources, thus facilitating the dispersion of RVA among communities of coexisting animals.It is worth emphasizing that these animals have a greater contact with the human populations of the studied areas since they cohabit with the humans in the region, besides having a high flow of movement between the forest extracts and environments chosen for the present study.',\n",
       "  'However, it is noteworthy that only in the communities of Santa Bárbara and Viseu were collected fecal specimens from asymptomatic humans for diarrhea and tested for RVA, but all were negative. It is notorious yet, the existence of different levels of degradation in the studied environments, considering the presented data. The fragmentation of the forest generates many consequences on the Amazonian biota, being able to alter the diversity and the composition of the animal communities in the fragments and even to interfere in the ecological processes, without considering that the fragments of forest in the Amazon are influenced by the climate, possibly facilitating the dispersion of pathogens by the environment, since the wild animals detected in the present study are asymptomatic and have low viral load for RVA.The occurrence of RVA in this population of animals may explain the possibility of dispersion of viral strains, since there is a proximity to the human population, besides the biological characteristics of these species that may represent important sources for gastroenteric viruses, along with the fact that all animals were asymptomatic for diarrhea.Wild birds have unlimited flight capacity, were captured in an interface region between the peridomicile and forest fragments and it is believed that this region has not been influenced by anthropic activities such as those observed in the area of the present study.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, the breeding method for poultry and canines close to homes and the forest ecosystem, as they are created in the communities surveyed, probably facilitates direct contact with possible sources of contamination, since in the areas the use of septic tanks is deficient and sometimes non-existent, which may facilitate or even increase the risk of viral dispersion throughout the environment.The high rates of increase and the analysis of land use in the researched areas may be important indicators of how these animals interact, since with deforestation, the populations of wild animals seek refuge in nearby communities facilitating the dispersal of infectious agents and the possible occurrence of carrier animals by direct contact or contamination of the local environment.To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a real-time PCR assay was applied for the detection of RVA involving a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, facilitating practical utility in epidemiological and molecular studies and assisting in a perspective in the elaboration of sanitary control and monitoring, preventing possible outbreaks in the studied communities.',\n",
       "  'The detection of positive animals was useful to monitor the infection of the agent in the animal population and to provide an early warning signal to predict an impending epidemic and a favorable risk for the human population, given the evidence of RVA circulation in the different forest fragments.In addition, the RT-qPCR assay may be a useful alternative for the differential diagnosis of RV in possible coexisting mixed infections clinically indistinguishable such as those caused by other viral strains that cause gastroenteritis such as: astrovirus, coronavirus, picobirnavirus, calicivirus, among others as observed in the studies of Jing et al. and Waruhiu et al. .Diarrhea associated with RVA infections in pigs is an important cause of increased mortality and economic losses in Europe. The most prevalent genotypes isolated from feces of Belgian diarrheal and non-diarrheal piglets in 2012  demonstrate a wide range of combinations of genotypes G / P including; G3P  , G4P  , G5P  , G4P  , G5P  , G9P  , G9P  and G9P  .',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, in the present study it was possible to detect only P  genotype, since majority of samples was asymptomatic for diarrhea.Finding shows that different P genotypes of RVA strains interact with distinct blood group histological antigens (HBGA, ABOH, Lewis) and sialic acids via VP4 providing insight into the regional prevalence and increased zoonotic potential of some RVA of origin swine  . The genotype P  was identified in piglets in Brazil  and in Italy and Japan resembling genotype P  human [65, 66] .In the population of animals studied the zoonotic transmission can be frequent, since the animals live in contact with humans and in precarious sanitary conditions. In Brazil, this genotype was described in animal and human populations in studies of Luchs et al. ; Honma et al. ; Araújo et al. ; Mascarenhas et al. and Lorenzetti et al.',\n",
       "  'such studies corroborate the importance of continuing to monitor genotypes to verify if uncommon strains or new strains are emerging and can infect animal populations or inter-species transmissions.Regarding the genotype P  , itwas most detected in our samples in bats, dogs, swine and feline. This genotype is not common in animals, being more detected in human and environmental samples in various parts of the world and included our region  . It is important to emphasize that the indicators of environmental contamination in Brazil are significant and contribute to the possibility of human-animal transmission  . Such data need further investigation in later work to better characterize the interspecies transmission, since the occurrence of enteric viruses in different matrices demonstrates the anthropogenic impact of the exposed population around and points to the potential risk of infection by the possible exposure of individuals susceptible.',\n",
       "  'Our findings may be useful for tracking fecal contamination in the environment using animals as possible sources thus minimizing the risk of infection by exposure to susceptible individuals, in this case different animal species or even human populations.RVA were detected in wild and domestic animals using a RT-qPCR assay that analyzed samples that had low viral load for RVA. Although the samples are asymptomatic for diarrhea, it is necessary to conduct strategies for the monitoring and control of the animals in the areas studied in the human population as well as in other species of animals, as well as the implementation of preventive measures aimed at future outbreaks in communities animals in the resident population in these impacted areas. Therefore, the present study is unprecedented in the region and in the country in relation to the research of RVA in wild animals.'],\n",
       " ['nanText: The main challenge may include (1) early identification of outbreak, (2) rapid expansion of patients, (3) high risk of nosocomial transmission, (4) unpredictability of size impacted, and (5) lack of backup resource. These challenges have caused severe shortage of healthcare workers, medical materials, and beds with isolation. The Spring Festival holiday has greatly aggravated the shortage of human resources and heavy traffic flow due to the vacation of healthy workers and factory workers, which further magnified the risk of transmission. The key point is to discriminate the infectious disease outbreak from regular clustering cases of flu-like diseases at early stage. There is a trade-off between false alarm causing population panic and delayed identification leading to social crisis.Early identification of 2019-nCoV infection presents a major challenge for the frontline clinicians. Its clinical symptoms largely overlap with those of common acute respiratory illnesses, including fever (98%), cough (76%), and diarrhea (3%), often more severe in older adults with pre-existing chronic comorbidities  .',\n",
       "  \"Usually, the laboratory abnormalities include lymphocytopenia and hypoxemia  . The initial chest radiographs may vary from minimal abnormality to bilateral ground-glass opacity or subsegmental areas of consolidation  . In addition, asymptomatic cases and lack of diagnosis kits result in delayed or even missed diagnosis inevitable and makes many other patients, visitors, and healthcare workers exposed to the 2019-nCoV infection.Critical care response to the outbreak of coronavirus should happen not only at the level of hospital, but also at the level of the city which is dominated by the government. At the early stage, the size of the patients' population is not beyond the capability of local infectious diseases hospital (IDH). The general hospital is responsible for fever triage, identifying suspected cases, and transferring to the local IDH. Such a plan is mandatory for every hospital. Shenzhen city has established a preexisting Infectious Disease Epidemic Plan (IDEP), which has facilitated managing and containing local outbreak of the 2019-nCoV.\",\n",
       "  'In case the patient load exceeds the hospital capability of the IDH, new IDHs should be considered either by building a temporary new IDH or reconstructing an existing hospital. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is racing against time to build two specialized hospitals for nCoV patients, namely Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospital, whereas a different strategy has been undertaken in Shenzhen city by reconstructing an existing hospital to become an IDH with capability of 800 beds.2019-nCoV patients should be admitted to singlebedded, negative pressure rooms in isolated units with intensive care and monitoring  . Clinical engineering should have plans to reconstruct standard rooms  . Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may be an expedient solution. Also, the general hospital may consider procedures such as suspending elective surgeries, canceling ambulatory clinics and outpatient diagnostic procedures, transferring patients to other institutions, and restricting hospital visitors  .',\n",
       "  \"More importantly, because the hospitals' ability to respond to the outbreak largely depends on their available ICU beds, the plan to increase ICU bed capacity needs to be determined.Caring for 2019-nCoV patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staff because of the following reasons: highly contagious with multiple transmission route, high exposure dose, long daily contact hours, and ICU stay. The basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9)  , or as high as between 3.6 and 4.0  . The 2019-nCoV is proved to be transmitted by respiratory droplets, contact, and fecal-oral, even transmission through the eye is possible [5, 6] . The higher viral load and aerosol-generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation, magnify the exposure and transmission risk [2, 7, 8] . Moreover, virus shedding can be prolonged and last for > 3 weeks according to some literature and our unpublished data  .\",\n",

Strict infection prevention and control practices have been implemented and audited in our units following the infection prevention and control plan published by China's National Health Committee (CNHC). In addition, wellequipped fever clinic as triage station with trained staff knowing 2019-nCoV case definitions is established. For suspected 2019-nCoV infection, several key points are crucial procedures: recording a detailed history, standardizing pneumonia workup, obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens [2, 8] , and implementing droplet isolation to break the transmission chain in the healthcare setting  .The risk of 2019-nCoV exposure may cause significant psychosocial stress on healthcare workers  . The death of a retired ENT physician from a 2019-nCoV infection has added to fears in January 2020.\",\n",
       "  'Psychotherapists have also been invited to join medical teams to evaluate and deal with potential stress and depression for the safety of the healthcare workers.Critical management 2019-nCoV management was largely supportive, including intubation, early prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) according to the recommendations updated by CNHC. Low-dose systematic corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and atomization inhalation of interferon were encouraged. These critical managements have worked well so far, as our 2019-nCoV patients had zero mortality. On the contrary, the previously reported mortality of 2019-nCoV patients in Wuhan ranged from 11 to 15% [1, 9] .'],\n",

       " ['Defining the connections among neurons is critical to our understanding of the structure and function of the nervous system. Recombinant viruses engineered to transmit across synapses provide a powerful approach for the dissection of neuronal circuitry in vivo. We recently demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be endowed with anterograde or retrograde transsynaptic tracing ability by providing the virus with different glycoproteins. Here we extend the characterization of the transmission and gene expression of recombinant VSV (rVSV) with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), and provide examples of its activity relative to the anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of rVSV. rVSV with RABV-G was found to drive strong expression of transgenes and to spread rapidly from neuron to neuron in only a retrograde manner. Depending upon how the RABV-G was delivered, VSV served as a polysynaptic or monosynaptic tracer, or was able to define projections through axonal uptake and retrograde transport.',\n",
       "  'In animals co-infected with rVSV in its anterograde form, rVSV with RABV-G could be used to begin to characterize the similarities and differences in connections to different areas. rVSV with RABV-G provides a flexible, rapid, and versatile tracing tool that complements the previously described VSV-based anterograde transsynaptic tracer.Text: Mapping neuronal connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS) of even simple organisms is a difficult task. Recombinant viruses engineered to trace synaptic connections and express transgenes promise to enable higher-throughput mapping of connections among neurons than other methods, e.g., serial reconstruction from electron micrographs (Bock et al., 2011; Briggman et al., 2011) . The Pseudorabies (PRV) and Rabies viruses (RABV) have been the best characterized and most utilized circuit tracing viruses to date (Ugolini et al., 1989; Kelly and Strick, 2000) . RABV was recently modified by Wickersham and colleagues such that it can travel across only one synapse, allowing for a straightforward definition of monosynaptic connections (Wickersham et al., 2007b) .',\n",
       "  'This strategy permitted the first unambiguous identification of retrogradely connected cells from an initially infected cell (\"starter cell\"), without the need for electrophysiology. Moreover, the starter cell could be defined through the expression of a specific viral receptor that limited the initial infection.Recently, we created an anterograde monosynaptic virus that complements the previously available retrograde viral tracers (Beier et al., 2011) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus related to RABV, with its own glycoprotein (G) gene (VSV-G), or with a G from the unrelated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-G), spreads in the anterograde direction across synapses. VSV can be used as a polysynaptic tracer that spreads across many synapses, owing to the fact that the normal, replicationcompetent form of the virus does not cause serious diseases in humans (Brandly and Hanson, 1957; Johnson et al., 1966; Brody et al., 1967) .',\n",
       "  'Whether the virus is a monosynaptic or polysynaptic tracer is determined by the method of delivery of the G gene ( Figure 1A) . Advantages of VSV are that it is well-characterized, is relatively simple in comparison to PRV, and it rapidly grows to high titer in tissue culture cells. It is also being developed as a vaccine vector, often using a G of another virus as the immunogen, as well as being developed as a cytocidal agent that will target tumor cells in humans (Balachandran and Barber, 2000; Stojdl et al., 2000 Stojdl et al., , 2003 .Previous studies of the anatomical patterns of transmission, as well as physiological recordings, have shown that the transmission of VSV and RABV among neurons is via synapses (Kelly and Strick, 2000; Wickersham et al., 2007b; Beier et al., 2011) .',\n",

The initially infected cell is indicated by an asterisk. VSV encoding a glycoprotein (G) within its genome can spread polysynaptically. The direction of the spread depends on the identity of the glycoprotein. Infected neurons are shown in green. In some cases, the initially infected starter cell can be defined by the expression of an avian receptor, TVA (tagged with a red fluorescent protein).',\n",
       "  'The TVA-expressing neurons can then be specifically infected by rVSV G with the EnvA/RABV-G (A/RG) glycoprotein (Wickersham et al., 2007b) on the virion surface [rVSV G(A/RG)]. These starter cells are then yellow, due to viral GFP and mCherry from TVA-mCherry expression. For monosynaptic tracing, the G protein is expressed in trans in the TVA-expressing cell, and thus complements rVSV G to allow transmission in a specific direction. (B) Genomic diagrams of rVSV vectors. All VSVs contain four essential proteins: N, P, M, and L.

       "  'In addition, we performed co-infections of rVSV with RABV-G and the anterograde form of rVSV in order to exploit the differences in the directionality of transmission of these two viruses in mapping circuits.Schematics of viruses created and used throughout this study are shown in Figure 1 . We created rVSV vector plasmids carrying different transgenes in either the first or fifth genomic positions ( Figure 1B) . After rescuing each virus, we tested the ability of each to express transgenes in different brain regions through intracranial injections ( Figure 1C ). All rVSV vectors drove robust fluorophore expression 1 or 2 days post-infection (hpi) ( Figure 1C ) (van den Pol et al., 2009) . In fact, by 12 hpi, labeling was sufficiently bright to image fine morphological details, such as dendritic spines ( Figure 1C ,iv).To characterize the physiological properties of cells infected with rVSV, we tested a replication-competent rVSV encoding GFP, with RABV-G in the genome in place of VSV-G [hereafter designated rVSV(RABV-G)].',\n",
       "  'van den Pol et al. reported that hippocampal neurons infected with replication-incompetent (G-deleted or \" G\") rVSV were physiologically healthy at 12-14 hpi, but were less so by 1 day post-infection (dpi) (van den Pol et al., 2009) . Given the known toxicity of both VSV and RABV-G (Coulon et al., 1982) , we tested the physiology of cortical pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex (M1) infected with rVSV(RABV-G). Between 12 and 18 hpi, the membrane capacitance, input resistance, resting membrane potential, and current-to-action potential firing relationship were indistinguishable between infected and uninfected neurons (Figure 2) . However, by 2 dpi, electrophysiological properties were so abnormal in the infected cortical pyramidal cells that physiological measurements could not be made.The speed and strength of the expression of transgenes encoded by VSV depends upon the gene\\'s genomic position (van den Pol et al., 2009; Beier et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'Genes in the first position are expressed the most highly, with a decrease in the level of expression in positions more 3 within the viral plus strand. When GFP was inserted into the first position of VSV, GFP fluorescence was first detectable at approximately 1 hpi in cultured cells (van den Pol et al., 2009) . In order to quantify the relative expression of a fluorescent protein in the first genomic position in neurons, rat hippocampal slices were infected with a replication-incompetent rVSV that expresses mCherry (rVSV G, Figures 1A,B) . This was a G virus which had the RABV-G supplied in trans during the preparation of the virus stock [referred to as rVSV G(RABV-G)].Average fluorescence intensity of the infected cells was measured every hour over the course of 18 h. By 4 hpi at 37 • C, red fluorescence was clearly visible, and reached maximal levels by approximately 14 hpi (N = 3, Figure 3 ).',\n",
       "  'Similar results were obtained with a virus encoding GFP in the first genomic position rather than mCherry (i.e., Figure 1B ) (N = 3).We previously demonstrated that rVSV(RABV-G) could be taken up retrogradely by neurons (Beier et al., 2011) , but these experiments did not distinguish between direct axonal uptake of the initial inoculum vs. retrograde transsynaptic transmission following viral replication. To distinguish between these two mechanisms and to extend the previous analyses, we conducted further experiments in the mammalian visual system (Figures 4A-G) . As visual cortex area 1 (V1) does not receive direct projections from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but rather receives secondary input from RGCs via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), infection of RGCs from injection of V1 would demonstrate retrograde transmission from cells which supported at least one round of viral replication. Following a V1 injection with rVSV(RABV-G), GFP-positive RGCs were observed in the retina by 3 dpi (N = 3; Figure 4G ).',\n",
       "  'Importantly, viral labeling in the brain was restricted to primary and secondary projection areas, even at 7 dpi. These included the LGN ( Figure 4D ) and the hypothalamus (Figure 4E) , two areas known to project directly to V1 (Kandel, 2000) . Selective labeling was observed in other areas, such as cortical areas surrounding V1 (Figure 4C) , which project directly to V1, and also in the superior colliculus (SC) stratum griseum centrale, which projects to the LGN ( Figure 4F) . Labeling was also observed in the nucleus basalis, which projects to the cortex, as well as many components of the basal ganglia circuit, which provide input to the thalamus [such as the caudate-putamen (CP), globus pallidus (GP), and the subthalamic nucleus (STn)]. The amygdala, which projects to the hypothalamus, was also labeled.',\n",
       "  'Consistent with a lack of widespread viral transmission, animals did not exhibit signs of disease at 7 dpi.These data show that rVSV(RABV-G) can spread in a retrograde direction from the injection site, but do not address whether the virus can spread exclusively in the retrograde direction. Directional transsynaptic specificity can only be definitively addressed using a unidirectional circuit. We therefore turned to the primary motor cortex (M1) to CP connection, in which neurons project from the cortex to the CP, but not in the other direction ( Figure 4H ) (Beier et al., 2011) . Injections of rVSV(RABV-G) into M1 should not label neurons in the CP if the virus can only label cells across synapses in the retrograde direction. Indeed, at 2 dpi, areas directly projecting to the injection site, including the contralateral cortex, were labeled ( Figure 4I ).',\n",
       "  'Only axons from cortical cells were observed in the CP, with no GFP-labeled cell bodies present in the CP (Figure 4J) , consistent with lack of anterograde transsynaptic spread. By 3 dpi, a small number of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the CP were observed, likely via secondary spread from initially infected thalamic or GP neurons (data not shown). A particular advantage of retrograde viral tracers is the ability to label CNS neurons projecting to peripheral sites. This has been a powerful application of both RABV and PRV (Ugolini et al., 1989; Standish et al., 1994) . To test if rVSV(RABV-G) could also perform this function, we examined the innervation of the dura surface by neurons of the trigeminal ganglion, a neuronal circuit thought to be involved in migraine headaches (Penfield and McNaughton, 1940; Mayberg et al., 1984) . These neurons have axons, but not canonical dendrites, and send projections into the spinal cord and brainstem.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, the only way trigeminal neurons could become labeled from viral application to the dura is through retrograde uptake of the virus. We applied rVSV(RABV-G) to the intact dura mater and analyzed the dura, trigeminal ganglion, and CNS for labeling ( Figure 4K ). At the earliest time point examined, 3 dpi, we observed axons traveling along the dura, but little other evidence of infection ( Figure 4L) . No labeled neuronal cell bodies on the dura were observed, consistent with the lack of neurons on this surface. In contrast, we did find labeled cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion ( Figure 4M ). No infection was seen in the CNS, even at 4 dpi, consistent with the lack of inputs from the brain into the trigeminal ganglion (N = 4 animals).To further characterize patterns and kinetics of viral transmission and directional specificity of transsynaptic spread, injections of rVSV(RABV-G) were made into the CP ( Figure 5A ).',\n",
       "  'In order to determine which cells were labeled by direct uptake of virus in the inoculum, a separate set of animals were injected into the CP with the replication-incompetent rVSV G(RABV-G) (N = 3 animals, analyzed 3 dpi). Cells labeled by rVSV G(RABV-G) were observed in the CP, GP, substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, and layers 3 and 5 of the cortex, consistent with infection at the axon terminal and retrograde labeling of cell bodies of neurons known to project directly to the CP ( Figure 5C ) (Albin et al., 1995) . Areas labeled by CP injection are indicated in Figure 5B .The patterns of spread for the replication-competent rVSV(RABV-G) were characterized over the course of 1-5 dpi ( Figures 5D-H) . During this interval, progressively more cells in infected regions were labeled by rVSV(RABV-G), including within the CP, nucleus basalis, cortex, and GP (listed in Figure 5B ).',\n",
       "  'In addition, more cortical cells were labeled in clusters near cortical pyramidal neurons, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected side, including neurogliaform cells (data not shown). These data are in contrast to those observed following infection with an anterograde transsynaptic tracing virus, such as rVSV with its own G gene, rVSV(VSV-G) (Figure 5B) . At 3 dpi following rVSV(VSV-G) injection into the CP, the cerebral cortex was not labeled, but regions receiving projections from the CP, such as the STn, GP, and SN, were labeled (Beier et al., 2011) .In order to investigate other areas for evidence of cell-to-cell retrograde transsynaptic spread, the nucleus basalis was examined following infection of the CP with replication-competent rVSV(RABV-G). The nucleus basalis was labeled by 2 dpi (Figures 5E-H) , consistent with at least a single transsynaptic jump, as this area does not directly project to the CP.',\n",
       "  'The virus appeared to travel transsynaptically at the rate of roughly 1 synapse per day, as evidenced by the lack of labeled neurogliaform cells in the cortex, and lack of neurons in the nucleus basalis at 1 dpi, and label appearing in these cell types/areas at 2 dpi, as previously observed (Beier et al., 2011) . Labeling remained well-restricted to the expected corticostriatal circuits at 5 dpi, suggesting that viral spread becomes less efficient after crossing one or two connections, consistent with injections into V1 (Figure 4) . While glial cells can be infected and were observed near the injection site (van den Pol et al., 2002; Chauhan et al., 2010) , infected glial cells away from the injection site generally were not observed.One advantage of having both anterograde and retrograde forms of the same virus is that they can be used in parallel, or in tandem, to trace circuitry to and from a single or multiple sites of injection, with each virus having similar kinetics of spread and gene expression.',\n",
       "  'In fact, if different fluorophores are used in different viruses, e.g., rVSV(VSV-G) and rVSV(RABV-G), then the viruses can be co-injected into the same site and their transmission can be traced independently ( Figure 6A ). This is most straightforward if there are no cells at the injection site that are initially infected by both viruses. Co-infected cells can be easily detected, as they would express both fluorescent proteins shortly after injection.In order to determine whether two viruses would allow simultaneous anterograde and retrograde transsynaptic tracing from a single injection site, a rVSV(VSV-G) expressing Venus and a rVSV(RABV-G) expressing mCherry were injected individually (Figures 6B-D) or co-injected (Figures 6E-G) into the motor cortex, and brains were examined 3 dpi. The pattern of labeling from the co-injected brains was equivalent to the patterns observed when each virus was injected individually: rVSV(VSV-G) was observed to infect neurons in the cortex, CP, and downstream nuclei, whereas the rVSV(RABV-G) was not observed to infect neurons in the CP, but rather in the thalamus and nucleus basalis (N = 4).',\n",
       "  'The initial co-infection rate is dependent upon The presence or absence of labeling is indicated by (+) and (−), respectively. The extent of labeling is indicated by the number of (+). Some animals were infected with G viruses to determine which areas were labeled by direct uptake of the virions, rather than by replication and transmission. These were sacrificed at 3 dpi. (C) Parasaggital section of a brain infected with VSV[greek delta]G(RABV-G). The injection site is marked by a red arrow. Several areas that project directly to the CP were labeled due to direct uptake of the virions, including the cortex, thalamus, and GP (arrowheads), 3 dpi. the dose of the initial inocula. When injecting 3 × 10 3 focus forming units (ffu) rVSV(VSV-G) and 3 × 10 4 ffu rVSV(RABV-G), no co-infection was observed at the injection site.',\n",
       "  'Thus, co-infection of the same brain region, without co-infection of the same cells,does not alter the spreading behavior of either rVSV(VSV-G) or rVSV(RABV-G). One example of how this dual retrograde and anterograde transsynaptic tracing system can be used is to determine if three Frontiers in Neural Circuits www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 11 | 8 distinct regions are connected and the directionality of any connections. For example, the anterograde transsynaptic virus can be injected into one region, the retrograde into another, and a third region can then be examined for evidence of labeling by either or both viruses (e.g., Figure 6H ). To test this possibility, rVSV(VSV-G) was injected into the motor cortex, rVSV(RABV-G) was injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulara (SNr), and animals were sacrificed at 3 dpi. We observed that cells were singly labeled, either with Venus [rVSV(VSV-G)] or with mCherry [rVSV(RABV-G)], and were located largely in different regions of the CP (Figures 6I,J) (N = 3) .',\n",
       "  \"These results suggest that the anterograde connections from the cells infected with rVSV(VSV-G) in the M1 were with CP MSNs that did not project to the region of the SNr injected with rVSV(RABV-G) (N = 3 animals).In addition to polysynaptic tracing, VSV can be modified to trace circuits monosynaptically (Beier et al., 2011) . With RABV, this was achieved in vivo by first infecting with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing TVA, a receptor for an avian retrovirus, and RABV-G (Wall et al., 2010) . This was followed 3 weeks later by infection with a G RABV with an EnvA/RABV-G chimeric glycoprotein on the virion surface (Wickersham et al., 2007b) , which allowed infection specifically of the cells expressing TVA. A similar strategy was used to test rVSV's ability to monosynaptically trace retrogradely connected neurons in vivo. Inputs to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing neurons in the striatum were used for this test.\",\n",
       "  'These neurons primarily receive input from the cortex and the thalamus (Thomas et al., 2000; Bloomfield et al., 2007) (Figure 7A) . In order to mark this population, we crossed ChAT-Cre mice to Ai9 mice, which express tdTomato in cells with a Cre expression history (Madisen et al., 2010) . Six-week-old mice from this cross were injected in the CP with two AAV vectors: one expressing a Cre-conditional (\"floxed\") TVA-mCherry fusion protein, and another expressing a floxed RABV-G. Two weeks later, the mice were injected in the same coordinates with rVSV G with the EnvA/RABV-G chimeric glycoprotein on the virion surface [rVSV G(A/RG)] (Beier et al., 2011) . Cells successfully infected with these two AAV vectors could host infection by a rVSV and should be able to produce rVSV virions with RABV-G on the surface. Such starter cells should also express tdTomato and GFP.',\n",
       "  'If rVSV were to be produced, and if it were to transmit across the synapse retrogradely, cortical and thalamic neurons should be labeled by GFP. Mice injected with these AAV and rVSV viruses were sacrificed 5 days after rVSV infection, and brains analyzed for fluorescence. As expected for starter cells, some neurons in the CP expressed both tdTomato and GFP (Figure 7B) . Outside of the CP, small numbers of GFP+ neurons that were not mCherry+ were observed in the cortex (Figures 7C,D) and thalamus (Figure 7E) , consistent with retrograde spread. Control animals not expressing Cre, or not injected with AAV encoding RABV-G, did not label cells in the cortex or thalamus (N = 3 for both controls and experimental condition).Here, we report on the use of rVSV as a retrograde transsynaptic tracer for CNS circuitry.',\n",
       "  'VSV can be modified to encode the RABV-G protein in the viral genome, allowing the virus to replicate and transmit across multiple synaptically connected cells, i.e., as a polysynaptic tracer. Alternatively, if the virus has the G gene deleted from its genome and RABV-G is provided in trans, it behaves as a monosynaptic tracer (Beier et al., 2011) . Although it has been known for many years that RABV travels retrogradely among neurons (Astic et al., 1993; Ugolini, 1995; Kelly and Strick, 2003) , and pseudotyping lentiviruses with RABV-G is sufficient for axonal transport (Mazarakis et al., 2001) , the retrograde transmission specificity among neurons had not been clearly shown to be a property of the G protein itself, as it might have been due to other viral proteins in addition to, or instead of, the viral G protein.',\n",
       "  'Since native VSV does not have these retrograde transsynaptic properties (van den Pol et al., 2002; Beier et al., 2011) , and the only alteration to the VSV genome was the substitution of the VSV G gene with the G gene of RABV, it is clear that the RABV glycoprotein is responsible for retrograde direction of viral transmission across synapses, at least in the case of rVSV.The early onset of gene expression from VSV relative to RABV (one hour vs. multiple hours) makes it beneficial in experimental paradigms in which the experiment needs to be done within a narrow window of time, such as tissue slices and explants. In addition, more than one transgene can be encoded in the viral genome without the need of a 2A or IRES element.',\n",
       "  'The use of the first position of the genome enhances the expression level of the transgene inserted at that location, since VSV (and RABV) express genes in a transcriptional gradient; therefore, the first gene is the most highly transcribed (Knipe, 2007) . This leads to rational predictions of expression levels so that one can choose the position of insertion of a transgene, or transgenes, according to this gradient and the desired level of expression. The size of the viral capsid is apparently not rigid, allowing for the inclusion of genomes that are substantially larger than the native genome, unlike the rigid capacity for some other viral vectors, such as AAV Yan et al., 2000) .The fact that VSV can be made to spread anterogradely (Beier et al., 2011) or retrogradely across synapses with the change of a single gene affords several advantages over viral tracers that heretofore have not shown such flexibility in the directionality of tracing.',\n",
       "  'In addition to the obvious application of tracing anterograde connections, combinations can be made to exploit the different forms of the virus. One example that employs the simultaneous infection with an anterograde and retrograde form of VSV is demonstrated in Figure 6 . This experiment was designed to address whether the anterograde projections from the cortex to the CP would label the same brain regions as were labeled by a retrograde virus injected into the SN. Although a block of superinfection by the virus may preclude infection of the same cell with multiple rVSVs, adjacent cells could still become labeled by different viruses (Whitaker-Dowling et al., 1983) . The observed results could be due to a preferential labeling by the anterograde transsynaptic virus of indirect pathway MSNs in this experiment, which then synapse onto the GP, thereby reflecting a viral bias.',\n",
       "  'Alternatively, it could indicate that the cortical neurons in the injected region largely do not label the MSNs that project to the area of the SN injected with the retrograde virus. One further possibility is that too little virus was used to observe co-labeling of a given region. However, given the density of infection (i.e., Figures 6I,J) , the latter possibility seems unlikely. Additionally, the spread of the polysynaptic rVSV(RABV-G) appears to attenuate with increasing numbers of synapses crossed, permitting an analysis of more restricted viral spread. This is quite fortuitous, as if spread were to continue, it would lead to widespread infection and lethality. In addition, reconstruction of connectivity would be more difficult. This reduced efficiency appears to also hold for the monosynaptic form of VSV complemented with RABV-G, as the efficiency of transmission appeared lower than the comparable experiment with RABV (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012) .',\n",
       "  'This is likely due to viral attenuation when VSV-G is replaced with RABV-G.We were attracted to the use of VSV as a viral tracer due to its long track record as a safe, replication-competent laboratory agent. Laboratory workers using VSV have not contracted any diseases, and natural VSV infections among human populations in Central America and the southwestern United States (Rodríguez, 2002) occur without evident pathology (Johnson et al., 1966; Brody et al., 1967) . VSV was thus an attractive candidate for its use as a polysynaptic tracer for CNS studies, which requires an ability to replicate through multiple transmission cycles. Both replicationcompetent and incompetent forms of VSV are in use under Biosafety Level 2 containment. Replication-competent RABV is Biosafety Level 3, due to the fact that infection with replicationcompetent RABV is almost always fatal to humans and in mice when infected intracerebrally (Smith, 1981; Knipe, 2007) .',\n",
       "  'Differences in pathogenicity between VSV and RABV are likely due to the ability of RABV to evade the innate immune system, particularly interferon (Hangartner et al., 2006; Junt et al., 2007; Lyles and Rupprecht, 2007; Rieder and Conzelmann, 2009; Iannacone et al., 2010) . VSV infection efficiently triggers an interferon response, and it has not evolved a method of escape from this response, unlike RABV (Brzózka et al., 2006) . In fact, VSV is being pursued as a vaccine for other viruses, including RABV (Lichty et al., 2004; Publicover et al., 2004; Kapadia et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2007; Iyer et al., 2009; Geisbert and Feldmann, 2011) . VSV does not typically spread beyond the initially infected site in the periphery (Kramer et al., 1983; Vogel and Fertsch, 1987) . This likely is the cause of the minor or absent symptoms in humans and animals infected in nature.',\n",
       "  'Polysynaptic VSV vectors are thus predicted to be much safer than polysynaptic RABV vectors. We have tested this prediction by injecting a series of mice in the footpads and hind leg muscles with rVSV(RABV-G), with the result that no injected animals showed any evidence of morbidity or mortality (Beier, Goz et al., in preparation) .While safer for laboratory workers than RABV, the main drawback to using VSV is its rapid cellular toxicity (van den Pol et al., 2009; Beier et al., 2011) . Toxicity is due to suppression of cellular transcription and a block in the export of cellular RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Black and Lyles, 1992; Her et al., 1997; Ahmed and Lyles, 1998; Petersen et al., 2000; von Kobbe et al., 2000) , as well as inhibition of the translation of cellular mRNAs (Francoeur et al., 1987; Jayakar et al., 2000; Kopecky et al., Frontiers in Neural Circuits www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 11 | 10 2001).',\n",
       "  'VSV is much quicker to enact its gene expression program than is RABV, such that cells suffer the toxic effects more quickly than after RABV infection. One aspect of VSV that can be exploited in the future to ameliorate the speed of toxicity is the use of VSV mutants and variants. One such mutant is the M51R, which permitted us to conduct physiological analyses of pre-and post-synaptic cells (Beier et al., 2011) . We are in the process of examining the transmission properties of this mutant in vivo, as well as the effects of other mutations or viral variants on prolonging the health of neurons after infection.rVSV vectors can be used to study the connectivity of neuronal circuitry. In addition to combinations of replication-competent forms of VSV, the replication-incompetent, monosynaptic forms of the virus can be easily combined, without the need to change viruses (Beier et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'This allows a straightforward way to study both the projections into, and out from, a genetically defined cell population. This can be done with the same viral genome, with the only change needed being the glycoprotein, for the selection of the direction of transmission. This flexibility of VSV makes it a powerful, multi-application vector for studying connectivity in the CNS.All rVSV clones were cloned from the rVSV G backbone (Chandran et al., 2005) . mCherry, Kusabira orange, Venus, and CFP were cloned into the first (GFP) position using XhoI and MscI sites, and VSV-G (a gift from Richard Mulligan, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and RABV-G (a gift from Ed Callaway, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) were cloned into the fifth (G) position using the MluI and NotI restriction sites.

       " ['BACKGROUND: Carrageenan is a clinically proven and marketed compound for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections. As infections caused by influenza virus are often accompanied by infections with other respiratory viruses the combination of a specific anti-influenza compound with the broadly active antiviral polymer has huge potential for the treatment of respiratory infections. Thus, the combination of the specific anti-influenza drug Zanamivir together with carrageenan in a formulation suitable for intranasal application was evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show in-vitro that carrageenan and Zanamivir act synergistically against several influenza A virus strains (H1N1(09)pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7). Moreover, we demonstrate in a lethal influenza model with a low pathogenic H7N7 virus (HA closely related to the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus) and a H1N1(09)pdm influenza virus in C57BL/6 mice that the combined use of both compounds significantly increases survival of infected animals in comparison with both mono-therapies or placebo.',\n",
       "  'Remarkably, this benefit is maintained even when the treatment starts up to 72 hours post infection. CONCLUSION: A nasal spray containing carrageenan and Zanamivir should therefore be tested for prevention and treatment of uncomplicated influenza in clinical trials.Text: The periodic appearance of new influenza variants poses a worldwide pandemic threat. Since the emergence of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%. Most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions [1, 2] . In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [3, 4] .',\n",
       "  'However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths  . For this reason WHO  and CDC  recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation.It is known that influenza virus infections are often accompanied by other viral pathogens  . Depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5-83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection     . The detection frequency with immunofluorescence was found to be even higher (90-100%) [13, 14] .',\n",
       "  'Potential concomitant viral pathogens of influenza virus infections include human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [14, 15] .As a result of the multiple infections, a specific anti-influenza mono-therapy treats the influenza virus infection only, but not the infection with the concomitant viral pathogen. Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [16, 17] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections  . Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms.',\n",
       "  'Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations.One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in  ). Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties  . The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [21, 22] .',\n",
       "  'Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells           and has been reviewed in    . We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV  and influenza A  replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials    . The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [41, 42] . The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms.',\n",
       "  'The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance Prieschl-Grassauer are co-founders of Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH. Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, preparation of the manuscript and is financing the processing charge of the manuscript. with the literature       we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries.At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea).',\n",
       "  'Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans  and farming  , the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group  .We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/ 8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi)  .Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally        . The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1).',\n",
       "  '156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46, 47, 53, 54] . These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46, 49, 52] .Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections-including influenza-with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections.',\n",

Mortality also includes mice that were sacrificed for ethical considerations when they had lost more than 25% of their initial body weight. We confirm the viral infection in these animals by necropsy and scoring of the lung inflammation.As the mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of NI and carrageenans are fundamentally distinct, they are likely to exhibit different activities towards the individual influenza virus strains. As a result, in combination they could complement each other to provide protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds.To test this hypothesis, we investigated the sensitivity of various influenza virus strains to Zanamivir and carrageenan in an adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells [60, 61] .',\n",

However, the IC 50 values varied widely depending on the influenza virus strain. The IC 50 values of Zanamivir ranged between 0.18 μM for H5N1 and 22.97 μM for H7N7 and that of carrageenan from 0.39 μg/ml to 118.48 μg/ml for H1N1(09)pdm and H7N7, respectively (see Table 1 ).',\n",

As described in  , isobolograms graphically compare the doses of two compounds needed to reach 50% inhibition to the predicted doses calculated based on a model of drug additivity. A curve linearity of~1 is expected for an additive compound interaction whereas a curve progression <1 argue for synergistic and >1 for an antagonistic compound interaction.Two virus strains were selected for those experiments, one being the most sensitive to carrageenan (H1N1(09)pdm) and one being the least sensitive (H7N7). In both cases the isobolograms show a synergistic interaction of carrageenan and Zanamivir (Fig 1) . Thus, it was shown that Zanamivir and carrageenan target individual influenza viruses with different efficiencies, most probably due to their different antiviral strategies.',\n",

In the influenza animal model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). Infection and treatment (twice a day for 5 days) are done intranasally without anesthesia. We investigated whether the combination of Zanamivir and carrageenan is more efficacious in reducing mortality than the corresponding mono-therapies.First, we determined the minimal effective dose of a Zanamivir mono-therapy that significantly improved survival time of H1N1 and H7N7 infected mice. For the H7N7 lethal infection the minimal effective dose of Zanamivir as mono-therapy ranged between 1 and 3 mg/kg BW/ day (data not shown). Next, we compared the antiviral activity of carrageenan (12 mg/kg BW/ day) and Zanamivir (1 and 3 mg/kg BW/day) mono-therapies with the respective combination versus placebo treatment.',\n",
       "  'Survival rates of mice with treatment starting 24 hpi are shown in Fig 2A. All placebo treated mice died between day 7 and 9 and also in all mono-therapy groups 100% lethality was observed until day 15. In contrast, the combination therapies led to 50% and 90% survival, depending on the Zanamivir concentration. Statistical analysis showed that the Zanamivir mono-therapy 1 mg/kg BW/day did not show a significant benefit (p = 0.1810), whereas the mono-therapy with 3 mg/kg BW/day significantly increased the survival rate compared with placebo treated mice (p = 0.0016). Both Zanamivir concentrations experienced significant benefit in survival by the combination with carrageenan (p<0.0001). Similarly, the combination therapies resulted in remarkably increased survival (p = 0.0421 for 1 mg and p<0.0001 for 3 mg/kg BW/day) when compared to the carrageenan mono-therapy. No statistically significant difference was observed between the combination containing 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir and that containing 1 mg/kg BW/day (p = 0.0525).',\n",
       "  'However, a trend for an increased survival rate with the higher Zanamivir concentration was evident. Therefore, for further investigation the combination therapy containing 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir was evaluated in lethally H7N7 infected mice.Next, the therapeutic potential of the combination with a delayed therapy start 48 or 72 hpi versus placebo treatment was explored. The survival rates of mice are shown in Fig 2B. All placebo treated mice died until day 10 and also in the group with the treatment start 72 hpi 100% lethality was found. In contrast, the combination therapy starting 48 hpi provided a statistically significant enhanced survival rate in comparison to placebo-treated mice (p = 0.0010).In summary, the combination of two effective, established mono-therapies resulted in a significantly enhanced survival in lethally H7N7 infected mice.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the combination therapy was highly efficient in comparison to placebo treatment even after a treatment onset up to 48 hpi.Intranasal therapy with carrageenan and Zanamivir starting 72 hpi significantly protects lethally influenza H1N1(09)pdm infected mice Next, the minimal effective dose of Zanamivir used as mono-therapy was evaluated in a lethal H1N1(09)pdm mouse model, following the same scheme as described in the H7N7 experiments. The lowest effective dose of Zanamivir after a treatment start 24 hpi was 1 mg/kg BW/ day and its combination with carrageenan was highly effective (data not shown). In the following experiment the therapeutic potential of the combination with a therapy start 48 or 72 hpi was investigated in comparison with the respective placebo treatment.As shown in Fig 3, the survival rates of mice treated with the combination therapy were highly significantly increased in comparison to the placebo group (p<0.0001).',\n",

We have previously shown that a combined therapy of iota-carrageenan with the NI Oseltamivir led to significantly enhanced survival in mice infected with H1N1 PR/8/34 in comparison with the respective mono-therapies  . However, Oseltamivir is an orally administered prodrug, which has to be converted into its active form by metabolic processing. Therefore, a further development of a combination nasal spray was not possible with Oseltamivir. Instead Zanamivir-a NI that is applied as active drug-was chosen for the development of a compound combination.During the evaluation process we found that the binding efficiency of different carrageenan subtypes on different influenza strains varies.',\n",
       "  'The combined use of iota-and kappa-carrageenan for the treatment of lethally influenza infected C57Bl/6 mice revealed a better therapeutic effect than the use of iota-carrageenan alone (S1 Fig). Thus, to provide a broader spectrum of activity against different influenza virus strains, a mixture of iota-and kappa-carrageenan (designated as carrageenan) was used for further evaluation.For investigation of the effect of a compound combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir, we examined their inhibition efficiency, individually and in combination, against influenza viruses in an adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells. The combination showed a synergistic inhibition of virus replication in in-vitro assays with all tested influenza viruses (Fig 1) . This indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the inhibition of the neuraminidase by Zanamivir. This was confirmed in in-vitro tests examining a potential influence of the polymer on the neuraminidase inhibiting activity of Zanamivir (data not shown).',\n",
       "  'Hence, the observed synergistic effect is based on the combination of two distinct underlying mechanisms. As a result, in the proposed combination both mechanisms would complement each other to provide more efficient protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds.The synergistic effect was also shown in lethal mice models (Fig 2 and Fig 3) . The pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mice varies and is dependent on the strain and its adaptation to the host. Depending on virus dose and strain, influenza viruses can induce lethal infections in certain mouse strains usually within two weeks [37, 63] . In our model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). In such a model, early virus replication takes place in the upper respiratory tract.',\n",

Of all in-vitro tested influenza strains the H1N1(09)pdm and the LP H7N7 are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, they are highly relevant pathogens, as placebo or with the mono-therapies consisting of carrageenan (12 mg/kg BW/day) or Zanamivir (1 and 3 mg/ kg BW/day) or a combination thereof. Treatment started 24 hpi and continued for 5 days.

The H1N1(09)pdm is associated with more than 18,400 deaths in the season 2009/2010 while the LP H7N7 carries an HA closely related to that of the avian influenza H7N9 virus which has caused more than 175 deaths until October 2014  . Second, they are of special interest for the carrageenan/Zanamivir combination approach. They have shown to differ in in-vitro susceptibility to carrageenan, Zanamivir (Table 1 ) and the combination thereof (Fig 1) . While H1N1(09)pdm was highly sensitive to inhibition by both substances alone, H7N7 required much higher concentrations of carrageenan and Zanamivir, respectively, to achieve similar inhibition efficiencies.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, both virus strains were chosen to further explore the efficiency of the combination therapy in a mouse model.We established lethal mouse models with both viruses that resulted in 6.8 and 8.5 mean survival days for LP H7N7 and H1N1(09)pdm, respectively. These results are in good accordance to similar already published lethal influenza models    . In our models the lowest effective dose for Zanamivir at a treatment start 24 hpi was found to be between 1 to 3 mg/kg BW/day for both viruses. This concentration range is relatively high in comparison to other published studies. However, these studies were done under anesthesia with different viruses and a prophylactic therapy start [65, 66] . The fact that a higher dose of NI is needed for an effective treatment when the therapy starts 24 hpi is already known for Oseltamivir  .',\n",
       "  'Nonetheless, also data with much higher effective concentrations (10 mg/kg BW/day  ) and with similar concentrations of Zanamivir (2.5 mg/kg BW/day  ) were published as well.We found that the combination of carrageenan with 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir used for treatment of H7N7 infected mice resulted in significantly enhanced survival of mice in comparison to both mono-therapies (Fig 2) . The significantly enhanced survival compared to the placebo treated group was also found after a delayed treatment start 48 hpi. Furthermore, in the H1N1(09)pdm model the combination of carrageenan with 1 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir showed statistically significant enhanced survival in comparison to placebo treatment even after a treatment start 72 hpi. This is a remarkable finding since NIs are normally not effective when applied 72 hpi.The finding supports the development of the Zanamivir and carrageenan combination approach.',\n",
       "  'As the intranasal treatment regime is incapable to effectively treat virus infections of the lung, the primary target of such a product is the prophylaxis and therapy of uncomplicated influenza. Since the majority of influenza infections causes uncomplicated illnesses and practically all cases of influenza start with an infection of the nasal cavity or the upper respiratory tract, the therapeutic potential is huge. However, clinical studies are required to elucidate and demonstrate the potential of the proposed combination therapy.Combination of antiviral strategies has led to impressive achievements in the combat against other viral disease like HIV. In particular the problem of antiviral resistance could be addressed with this strategy. In the last decade concerns have been raised about the increased emergence of Oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses. The augmented appearance of viruses carrying the mutation H275Y in the neuraminidase of H1N1(09)pdm viruses that confers resistance to Oseltamivir left Zanamivir as only treatment option for symptomatic patients infected with an Oseltamivir resistant influenza strain  .',\n",
       "  'In contrast to Oseltamivir, resistance to Zanamivir is less frequent. To date, Zanamivir resistant influenza has been detected only once, in an immunocompromised patient [71, 72] . However, lessons should be learned from previous anti-influenza interventions which resulted in occurrence of resistance against currently approved drugs  . Therefore, concerns are comprehensible that an increased Zanamivir use may also lead to the rapid emergence of resistances  . To overcome this threat, a combination of antivirals which inhibits virus replication by distinct mechanisms is a valid strategy. We checked for the possibility of generating double compound escape mutant viruses while passaging viruses in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound combinations. After 10 passages in MDCK cells no resistance to the compound combination for any tested influenza virus could be found (data not shown). However, this finding does not guarantee that emergence of Zanamivir escape mutants can be completely halted.In summary, we demonstrated that the anti-influenza mechanisms of both single compounds complement each other.',\n",
       "  'The combination provides synergistically better protection against a broader spectrum of influenza viruses than the individual compounds.A nasal spray containing carrageenan together with Zanamivir provides an easy to apply treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in patients under suspicion to be influenza infected. Patients would benefit from the fast and efficient treatment of uncomplicated influenza in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the faster influenza virus clearance from the upper respiratory tract and the independent antiviral mechanism of carrageenan and Zanamivir the likelihood to develop escape mutations against Zanamivir will be reduced. Both individual compounds are able to reduce severity and/or duration of the influenza illness and a combination is expected to work similarly. Additionally, due to the broad antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan, patients will receive in parallel a treatment of concomitant viral infections. Therefore, patients will benefit from a decreased probability to develop complications.',\n",
       "  'In consideration of the complications known to accompany an influenza virus illness this combinational therapy meets an urgent medical need.A second scope of this combination is the protection against newly emerging pandemic viruses during the time until identification of the virus followed by manufacturing and distribution of vaccines  . Even if, due to new reverse genetic techniques, less time for production of vaccines is needed, it still takes months before large quantities of vaccine are available  . During this time the human population should be protected to decelerate viral spread. At the moment the only available opportunities for personal protection are hygiene measures and the use of Tamiflu (brand name of Oseltamivir).Novel protection and treatment options for influenza are desperately needed. Based on our encouraging results in mice we suggest testing a nasal spray containing carrageenan in combination with the neuraminidase inhibitor Zanamivir in clinical trials for prevention or treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections.Supporting Information S1 Fig.',\n",

       " ['nanText: The emergence and outbreak of a newly discovered acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, China, has affected greater than 40,000 people, and killed more than 1,000 as of Feb. 10, 2020. A new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified, and the associated disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) (https://globalbiodefense. com/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-portal/).According to what has been reported    , COVID-2019 seems to have similar clinical manifestations to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence also has ∼80% identity with SARS-CoV, but it is most similar to some bat beta-coronaviruses, with the highest being >96% identity [4, 5] .Currently, there are speculations, rumours and conspiracy theories that SARS-CoV-2 is of laboratory origin. Some people have alleged that the human SARS-CoV-2 was leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported, which shared ∼96% homology with the SARS-CoV-2  .',\n",
       "  'However, as we know, the human SARS-CoV and intermediate host palm civet SARSlike CoV shared 99.8% homology, with a total of 202 single-nucleotide (nt) variations (SNVs) identified across the genome  . Given that there are greater than 1,100 nt differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV  , which are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2. The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species (bats) are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. A search for an intermediate animal host between bats and humans is needed to identify animal CoVs more closely related to human SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       "  'There is speculation that pangolins might carry CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, but the data to substantiate this is not yet published (https:// www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00364-2).Another claim in Chinese social media points to a Nature Medicine paper published in 2015  , which reports the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells  . However, this claim lacks any scientific basis and must be discounted because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides).The mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15)  was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice. After 15 passages in mice, the SARS-CoV gained elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice (hence M15), due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation.',\n",
       "  'It is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation.It was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells [10, 11] . Civets were proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans [6, 12] . However, in 2013 several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry  . Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV  , it was proposed that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts.',\n",
       "  'To directly address this possibility, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice  .Due to the elevated pathogenic activity of the SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus relative to MA15 chimeric virus with the original human SARS S gene in mice, such experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy (https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-weare/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pausegain-function-research).',\n",
       "  'The current COVID-2019 epidemic has restarted the debate over the risks of constructing such viruses that could have pandemic potential, irrespective of the finding that these bat CoVs already exist in nature. Regardless, upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [5, 14] , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome. Therefore, once again there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus.There are also rumours that the SARS-CoV-2 was artificially, or intentionally, made by humans in the lab, and this is highlighted in one manuscript submitted to BioRxiv (a manuscript sharing site prior to any peer review), claiming that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory.',\n",
       "  'In a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random  . Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report.Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13. In our view, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host.',\n",

       " ['Over the last century, the successful attenuation of multiple bacterial and viral pathogens has led to an effective, robust and safe form of vaccination. Recently, these vaccines have been evaluated as delivery vectors for heterologous antigens, as a means of simultaneous vaccination against two pathogens. The general consensus from published studies is that these vaccine vectors have the potential to be both safe and efficacious. However, some of the commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. This review examines the literature on this topic, and concludes that for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses.Text: In the fields of medicine and veterinary medicine, there are numerous live, attenuated bacterial and viral vaccines in use today worldwide.',\n",
       "  'The safety and efficacy of such vaccines is well established and allows further development as vector systems to deliver antigen originating from other pathogens. Various attenuated bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), specifically Lactococcus lactis, Mycobacterium, Listeria, Shigella and Salmonella, have been tested for the targeted delivery of heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts (Bahey-El-Din et al., 2010; Innocentin et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2011; Tobias et al., 2008 Tobias et al., , 2010 Tobias & Svennerholm, 2012) . Bacteria such as E. coli and lactic acid bacteria have recently gained favour, as E. coli is a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items and are therefore naturally present in the host. They are also a much safer option than traditional attenuated vaccines in children and immunecompromised people.',\n",
       "  \"As this review discusses the effects of pre-existing immune responses to attenuated vaccines, further discussion of LAB and E. coli as potential vectors will not be undertaken; however, the reader is directed to several interesting reviews (Bermú dez-Humarán et al., 2011; Wells & Mercenier, 2008) . Intracellular bacteria from the genera Mycobacterium (Guleria et al., 1996) , Listeria (Gentschev et al., 2001) , Shigella (Levine et al., 1997) and Salmonella (Dougan et al., 1987) are considered to be suitable candidates for the delivery of vaccine antigens due to their capability to induce robust T cell immune responses (Alderton et al., 1991; Lo et al., 1999; Mastroeni et al., 2001; Mittrücker & Kaufmann, 2000; Nauciel, 1990) . Salmonella is one genus that has been well examined as a vector, building on the extensive research available on the micro-organism's physiology and pathogenesis (Basso et al., 2000; Killeen & DiRita, 2000; Sirard et al., 1999; Ward et al., 1999) .\",\n",
       "  'There exist several commercial vaccines that are used as anti-Salmonella vaccines in humans and animals (e.g. Ty21a for typhoid fever in humans, several Salmonella serovars against salmonellosis in chickens and other animals). The general strategy for vectoring heterologous antigen is depicted in Fig. 1 . The first clinical trial of a recombinant, which was conducted over 20 years ago using an attenuated Salmonella as a delivery vector, led to the widespread testing of this bacterium as a mucosal delivery system for antigens from non-Salmonella pathogens (Dougan et al., 1987) . These studies have demonstrated the utility of live bacteria to deliver expressed antigens and DNA vaccines to the host immune system (Atkins et al., 2006; Husseiny & Hensel, 2008; Jiang et al., 2004; Kirby et al., 2004) . Since then several other intracellular bacterial vectors have been successfully tested for their capability to deliver a variety of antigens from various pathogens, as well as vaccination against cancer.',\n",
       "  'One genus which has been widely tested as vector is Listeria. Listeria species are Gram-positive intracellular food-borne pathogens. The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells (Cossart & Mengaud, 1989; Kaufmann, 1993; Pamer et al., 1997) . Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and ease of using Listeria monocytogenes to deliver heterologous vaccine antigens and DNA vaccines Jensen et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2011; Peters et al., 2003; Shen et al., 1995; Yin et al., 2011) .Similarly, various viral vectors have been successfully tested for their capability to deliver heterologous vaccine antigens, and this generally results in the induction of strong CTL immune responses.',\n",
       "  'In the veterinary field, there are numerous viral vector vaccines that are currently licensed for use in livestock and domesticated animals. These recombinant vaccines are based on both DNA viruses (such as fowlpox virus-based vaccines which target avian influenza virus and fowlpox virus, or vaccinia virusbased vectors against the rabies virus in wildlife) and RNA viruses [such as Newcastle disease virus-based vaccines to be used in poultry or yellow fever virus (YFV)-based vaccines to be used in horses against West Nile virus] (Draper & Heeney, 2010) . Based on the safety record in the veterinary field, many viruses have been studied for human use as a vector in vaccine development (Beukema et al., 2006; Esteban, 2009; Schirrmacher & Fournier, 2009; Stoyanov et al., 2010; Weli & Tryland, 2011) .',\n",
       "  'Amongst them, YFV (YF-17D strain) was the first to be licensed for use in humans, where the cDNAs encoding the envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with the corresponding genes of an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus strain, SA14-14-2 (Appaiahgari & Vrati, 2010; Rollier et al., 2011) . Poxviruses are also studied extensively as candidate vectors for human use, among which attenuated derivatives of vaccinia virus [such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and New York attenuated vaccinia virus NYVAC strains] are the most promising vectors (Esteban, 2009; Gó mez et al., 2008; Rimmelzwaan & Sutter, 2009 ). They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability (Minke et al., 2004) . The NYVAC vector has been shown to induce CD4 + T cell-dominant responses, and MVA induces both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (Mooij et al., 2008) .',\n",
       "  'The adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses (Alexander et al., 2012; Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009; Vemula & Mittal, 2010; Weyer et al., 2009) . They have been extensively examined as a delivery vector in several preclinical and clinical studies for infectious diseases such as anthrax, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), malaria and tuberculosis M. Saxena and others (Chengalvala et al., 1994; Gao et al., 2006; Hashimoto et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 1992; Limbach & Richie, 2009; Radosevic et al., 2007; Shiver et al., 2002) .However, before vectored vaccines can be used in the human population they need to satisfy several important criteria.',\n",
       "  'Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable (of course the minor discomfort that accompanies many vaccinations is normal). Secondly, a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost, and this is particularly important in resource-poor countries (Killeen & DiRita, 2000) . Similar constraints apply to veterinary vaccines, with cost often an even more important consideration. Finally, long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose (Atkins et al., 2006) .As some of the vectors in use will have been seen by the host immune system prior to vaccination, whether the presence of pre-existing immune responses is detrimental for the further development of a vector-based vaccine scheme, or can augment responses to the vectored antigen, needs to be considered in detail.',\n",
       "  'This is the subject of this review. In discussing the possible effects on pre-existing immunity, the natural immunity to the vector needs to be considered. Therefore, considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response). This will theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared. Surprisingly, as will be seen in some of the examples given below, this can have results that differ depending on the magnitude of the response to the vectored antigen. Similarly, for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen.',\n",
       "  'Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.In the case of bacterial vectors, the effect of pre-existing immune responses has only been tested using Salmonella serovars and Listeria spp. Concern that prior immunological experience of the host with either the homologous Salmonella vector strain or a related strain might compromise its ability to deliver heterologous vaccine antigen was first raised in 1987 (Dougan et al., 1987) . Bao and Clements subsequently reported experimental evidence of the consequences of prior exposure of animals to the vector strain (Bao & Clements, 1991) . This work showed that both serum and mucosal antibody responses against the foreign antigen were in fact upregulated in animals with prior exposure to the vector strain. Whittle & Verma (1997) reported similar findings.',\n",
       "  'Mice immunized via the intra-peritoneal route with a Salmonella dublin aroA mutant expressing heterologous antigen after being exposed to the same vector showed a higher immune response to the vectored antigen in comparison to mice without any immunological memory against the vector.Subsequently, several studies have been conducted to examine the effect of pre-existing immunity in the host against Salmonella. These results are summarized in Table 1 .The various reports are contradictory in their findings and seem to paint a rather confusing picture. Some studies concluded that pre-existing immunity against the Salmonella vector leads to stronger immune responses against the delivered antigen (Bao & Clements, 1991; Jespersgaard et al., 2001; Kohler et al., 2000a, b; Metzger et al., 2004; Saxena et al., 2009; Sevil Domènech et al., 2008; Whittle & Verma, 1997) , with others considering pre-existing immunity to be a limiting factor in the long-term use of Salmonella as an efficient vector for antigen delivery (Attridge et al., 1997; Gahan et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 1999; Sevil Domènech et al., 2007; Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003a, b) .A slight majority of the studies listed in Table 1 (10 versus eight) indicate the upregulation of immune responses after animals have been exposed to either homologous or related strains before the delivery of heterologous antigen using a Salmonella vector.',\n",
       "  'A study by Metzger and co-workers on human volunteers using Salmonella Typhi as a vector suggested that there was no change in the T cell immune response against the heterologous antigen in human volunteers who were exposed to empty vector in comparison with volunteers who were immunologically naive of the vector strain (Metzger et al., 2004) . In these subjects, humoral responses were moderately elevated in preexposed individuals. Similarly, Saxena et al. (2009) indicated higher humoral and T cell responses in mice pre-exposed to homologous or heterologous Salmonella strains. The interleukin 4 (IL4) response was significantly higher when the animal host was exposed to the homologous strain, whereas pre-exposure to a related species did not have such an impact on IL4 responses. Conversely interferon (IFN)-c responses were higher, irrespective of the strain to which mice were pre-exposed.',\n",
       "  'This study also indicated that the presence of homologous or heterologous opsonizing antibodies leads to a higher uptake of Salmonella by macrophages in vitro, which may explain the higher immune responses in exposed mice. As may be expected, uptake was higher when homologous sera were used as the opsonin rather than heterologous sera. This is depicted in Fig. 2 .Conversely, there are reports that indicate that pre-existing immunity against the bacterial vector downregulates immune responses against the delivered heterologous antigen using similar or related vectors. Attridge and coworkers reported that the presence of immunity against the bacterial vector prior to the delivery of vectored antigenic Microbiology 159 protein can downregulate immune responses in mice against the delivered antigen (Attridge et al., 1997) . Similar results were reported by Roberts et al. (1999) and Vindurampulle & Attridge (2003a, b) .',\n",
       "  'However, the latter authors found that the hypo-responsiveness could be largely eliminated by exposing animals to the foreign antigen prior to vectorpriming (Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003b) . Unfortunately, this would appear to be impractical for an immunization regimen! A study presented by Gahan et al. (2008) immunized mice with S. Typhimurium expressing C fragment of tetanus toxin antigen from an expression plasmid or as a DNA vaccine. Vaccinated mice developed humoral responses to LPS and tetC (for the plasmid-bearing vaccines). Animals from all groups (including a previously unvaccinated group) were immunized on day 182 with Salmonella expressing tetC. At this time, the anti-LPS and tetC titres were beginning to wane. Fourteen days after the second immunization, the colonization of various mouse organs was assessed. The ability to colonize was found to be significantly reduced in groups that had been previously vaccinated with Salmonella.',\n",
       "  'In view of this finding, it was perhaps not surprising that at day 210 the LPS titres were not significantly different between groups receiving one or two vaccinations. More interestingly, mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses. Whether the same is true for cellular responses was not evaluated.Other studies have evaluated cellular responses. A study by Sevil Domènech and colleagues reported that pre-existing anti-vector immunity seriously compromises CD8 + responses in mice when exposed to a similar strain used as vector (Sevil Domènech et al., 2007) . In contrast, another study by the same authors reported that animals exposed to related vectors induce much higher CD8 + responses when compared with animals which do not have any pre-existing Salmonella immunity (Sevil Domènech et al., 2008) .',\n",
       "  'The difference between these two studies was that in the first, the prime and boost were with identical serovars, while in the second study, different serovars were used. This may point to a way of avoiding downregulation of CD8 responses by pre-existing immunity. This is important, as one of the advantages of using Salmonella (an intracellular pathogen) is that strong cellular immune responses can be induced.It must be noted that in the case of Salmonella vaccines, effects other than strictly immunological responses (particularly adaptive responses) should be considered. In the context of innate immunity, it was shown that administration of non-virulent Salmonella to gnobiotic pigs eliminated disease following challenge with a virulent strain (Foster et al., 2003) . Interestingly, protection was not by competitive exclusion, as the virulent strain was in high numbers in the gut but did not distribute systemically.',\n",
       "  'The protection was proposed to be mediated by the infiltration of a large number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the gut, and although perhaps impractical as a general prophylactic (as the time between vaccination and infection is short), this may be an option for short-term or perhaps therapeutic vaccination (as reviewed by Foster et al., 2012) .Chickens (Gallus gallus) are a natural animal reservoir for Salmonella, which makes them an important source of Salmonella-associated gastroenteritis in humans. The ability to use oral Salmonella vaccines to immunize against heterologous pathogens would be of enormous benefit to Uptake of STM-1 by J774 macrophages, relative to the highest uptake percentage.

       "  'Both vertical and horizontal transmission is associated with Salmonella in chickens (Liljebjelke et al., 2005) . Vertical transmission via in ovo transmission is particularly important, because if there is prior exposure to the vaccine strain, subsequent vaccination using an oral Salmonella vector could be severely compromised. A considerable number of studies on cross-protective immunity and competitive exclusion have been undertaken in chickens. Protective cross-reactive immunity against Salmonella strains has been demonstrated against both homologous and heterologous challenges (Beal et al., 2006) , although cross-serogroup protection was not strong. Furthermore, a recent study reported that pretreatment of newly hatched chickens with different Salmonella strains could produce a complete invasioninhibition effect on any subsequent exposure to both homologous and heterologous strains (Methner et al., 2010) . Pre-exposure with a highly invasive form of Salmonella Enteritidis caused a large influx of heterophils to the caecal mucosa in 1-day-old chicks, and subsequent heterologous caecal colonization was inhibited for a period of 48 h (Methner et al., 2010) .',\n",
       "  'The implications of this kind of colonization-inhibition study on the immunological status of the affected chickens are yet to be fully elucidated. It should be noted that the studies listed in Tables 1 and 2 are controlled laboratory studies, with the possibility of a competitive exclusion component to immunity not discussed.Similarly studies of L. monocytogenes and the effects of preexisting immune responses indicate conflicting results. A study by Bouwer et al. (1999) indicates that pre-existing immune responses against the Listeria vector do not diminish immune responses against the delivered heterologous antigen, and a similar study by Starks et al. (2004) also concluded that prior exposure of mice to the empty Listeria vector did not influence anti-cancer immune responses when a similar mutant was used as a carrier of a melanoma cancer antigen. Similar findings were reported by Whitney et al. (2011) in rhesus macaques in which L. monocytyogens was used as a carrier of gag-HIV antigen.',\n",
       "  'Conversely, studies by Stevens et al. (2005) in which L. monocytogens was used to deliver feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) gag protein and as a carrier of DNA vaccines to vaccinate cats against FIV envelope protein indicated lower immune responses against the delivered antigen in cats exposed to empty Listeria vector in comparison with naive animals (Stevens et al., 2005) . Similar findings have been reported by Tvinnereim et al. (2002) and Leong et al. (2009) . However, taken together, these studies conclude that prior exposure of host animals to empty vector does not abrogate immune responses to the vectored antigen, but only reduces them somewhat. Only the study by Vijh et al. (1999) indicated that exposure to the empty vector may completely abrogate immune responses against the delivered antigens (Vijh et al., 1999) . However, these studies also indicate that downregulation of antigenspecific immune responses is highly dependent on dose and time.',\n",
       "  'Leong et al. (2009) also demonstrated that the negative impact of vector-specific immune responses can also be countered by repeated immunization with the same vaccine and dose; this in effect leads to higher priming of naive T cells against the delivered antigen. Of course, such repeated vaccination may not be practicable in real-world situations.Despite the many advantages which viral vectoring can offer, pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] (Hocknell et al., 2002; Pichla-Gollon et al., 2009) . Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens (Pichla-Gollon et al., 2009; Pine et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 (Buchbinder et al., 2008) . For an HSV-1-based vector vaccine, it has been demonstrated that pre-existing anti-HSV-1 immunity reduced, but did not abolish, humoral and cellular immune responses against the vaccine-encoded antigen (Hocknell et al., 2002; Lauterbach et al., 2005) . However, Brockman and Knipe found that the induction of durable antibody responses and cellular proliferative responses to HSVencoded antigen were not affected by prior HSV immunity (Brockman & Knipe, 2002) . Similarly, pre-existing immunity to poliovirus has little effect on vaccine efficacy in a poliovirus-vectored vaccine (Mandl et al., 2001) .',\n",
       "  'Different effects of pre-existing immunity on the efficacy of recombinant viral vaccine vectors are summarized in Table 2 .There are several approaches to avoiding pre-existing vector immunity, such as the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006) . The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) .As we search for new vaccine approaches for the array of pathogens for which none is yet available, revisiting proven vaccines and developing these further has gained M. Saxena and others momentum.',\n",
       "  'Hence, attenuated bacteria and viruses which have a long history of efficacy and safety are being brought into use. While very attractive, a common theme in these experimental approaches has been the limitations that preexisting immunity to the vector may pose. However, as this examination of the relevant literature shows, there is a rather confusing picture, with some studies in fact indicating that pre-existing immunity may be a friend, rather than foe.Few studies using viral vectors have reported on the influence of pre-existing immunity on humoral responses. Generally speaking, for bacterial-delivered antigens, the humoral responses were influenced by pre-existing immunity, with slightly more studies finding augmentation rather than diminution. Why is there variation? This may be due to several factors, including the type of Salmonella used and its invasiveness.',\n",
       "  \"Dunstan and colleagues tested the ability of six isogenic Salmonella serovar Typhimurium strains harbouring different mutations for their ability to induce immune responses against the C fragment of tetanus toxin and concluded that the strain which had the least ability to colonize Peyer's patches induced the lowest immune responses (Dunstan et al., 1998) .Similarly, the boosting time and nature of the antigen used might be important. Attridge and colleagues indicated the importance of boosting time. In one experiment, boosting mice at 10 weeks led to complete inhibition of antibody responses against the delivered heterologous antigen; however, when the mice were boosted at 4 weeks, the downregulation of antibody responses was not so prominent (Attridge et al., 1997) . A similar study conducted by Kohlers and colleagues shows that boosting at 7 weeks after pre-exposing animals to empty vector leads to lower antigen-specific IgG and secretory IgA responses; however, boosting at 14 weeks leads to higher IgG and secretory IgA responses (Kohler et al., 2000b) .\",\n",
       "  'This is in conflict with the above result, although it should be mentioned that they used different Salmonella species. Vindurampulle and Attridge also examined the impact of the Salmonella strain and the nature of the antigens used. In their study, they used S. Dublin and Salmonella Stanley aroA mutants to deliver E. coli K88 and LT-B antigens, and concluded that the effect of pre-existing immunity depends on both the strain used and the type of antigen delivered (Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003b) .All these studies on the effect of pre-existing immunity discuss the impact on humoral responses. Sevil Domenech and colleagues reported that pre-exposing animals to the homologous Salmonella vector leads to a significant reduction in CD8 + responses; however, exposure of animals to a heterologous strain leads to significantly higher CD8 + responses (Sevil Domènech et al., 2007 , 2008 .',\n",
       "  'Saxena and colleagues also reported that antigenspecific T cell responses were either similar or significantly higher, with no downregulation in T cell responses observed after pre-exposing mice to either homologous or heterologous strains (Saxena et al., 2009) .For viral vectors, the impact of cell-mediated immunity was more pronounced, and as depicted in Table 2 , almost always resulted in a reduction in the subsequent immune response. Presumably this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes (Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) . As these authors conclude, it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes.',\n",
       "  'It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response. We have previously shown that this is indeed the case (Saxena et al., 2009 ) (depicted in Fig. 2 ).',\n",
       "  'It would be of great benefit to address these issues not only in mice but also in other organisms such as chickens, which are the most likely host to be targeted for the use of live Salmonella vectors, specifically where the vaccines are developed for use in livestock and poultry.To summarize, bacterial vectors such as Salmonella and viral vectors such as Ad show great promise as delivery vehicles for heterologous antigens; however, prior exposure to the vector must be considered. By judicious selection of the strain/serotype it will be possible to avoid the negative effects and it may indeed be possible to positively influence the response, particularly for humoral immunity.'],\n",
       " ['Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease in newborn piglets and causes substantial economic losses in the world. PED virus (PEDV) spreads by fecal–oral contact and can be prevented by oral immunization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective oral vaccine against PEDV infection. Currently, Bacillus subtilis as recombinant vaccine carrier has been used for antigen delivery and proved well in immune effect and safety. The present study evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis-RC) in piglets via oral administration. After oral immunization in piglets, B. subtilis-RC significantly increased the local mucosal immune responses. Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC significantly improved the level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against PEDV infection, through enlarging the area of Peyer’s patches (PPs) and increasing the number of ileum IgA(+) secreting (SIgA) cells. In the meantime, B. subtilis-RC remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs).',\n",
       "  'We also observed that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC significantly increased CD3(+)T lymphocytes’ numbers and up-regulated the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against PEDV infection. In summary, our study demonstrated that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against PEDV infection in piglets.Text: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) characterized by highly fatal acute diarrhea in piglets, results in enormous losses in the worldwide pig industry  . The causative agent PED virus (PEDV) belongs to the porcine coronaviruses (CoVs). PEDV infection mainly spreads through the digestive tract  , and damages the host intestine mucosal surfaces by infecting the intestine epithelial cells  . Therfore enhancing intestinal mucosal immunity can elicit effective mucosal immune responses against PEDV infection  .',\n",
       "  'Currently, traditional vaccines (intramuscular route or subcutaneous injection) have been developed and applied widely in the market  . These vaccines administered parenterally cannot effectively induce high titers of maternal antibodies and virus-specific IgA antibodies, resulting in inadequate mucosal protection to against PEDV infection  . Furthermore, these maternal antibodies in the milk were always degraded by gastric acid and pepsin before entering the intestinal tract. Effective PEDV vaccines must provide adequate mucosal protection in the intestinal tract. However, the effective vaccines are currently lacking  .As a superior way of mucosal immunization, oral administration can protect the gut and stimulate the common mucosal immune system  . Besides, oral immunization has several attractive features which include safety, and a straightforward, inexpensive, and needle-free approach  . Therefore, oral immunization often delivers large amounts of antigens to prevent the diarrheal diseases  .',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, there are several challenges by oral immunization, which consist of physical, chemical, and biological barriers when delivering antigens to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (such as gastric acids, pepsin, and trypsin in the GI tract)  .It is a substantial problem that digestive acids and proteases can degrade antigen proteins for nutrient absorption  . Therefore, the vaccine delivery system has been applied to solve the problem. The system can protect antigens from the severe environment of the GI tract and deliver antigens to intestinal mucosa  . Currently, Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) is widely used as a vaccine delivery system for its unique characteristics.As a nonpathogenic Gram-positive bacterium, B. subtilis has been regarded as a novel probiotic and food additive in humans and animals  . The B. subtilis has adjuvant activity and can deliver heterologous antigens to the GI tract, providing additional immunity stimulation  .',\n",
       "  \"Besides, research had shown that orally administered B. subtilis could also enhance immune regulation and gut health in pigs  . Moreover, oral administration of B. subtilis could elicit humoral and cellular immune responses to the maintenance of gut homeostasis by dendritic cells (DCs)  . DCs are the most important professional antigen-presenting cells and can effectively regulate antibody titers  . DCs naturally exist in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), including Peyer's patches (PPs), isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and scatter throughout the subepithelial lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and colon  . Furthermore, B. subtilis is convenient for genetic manipulation and has developed a large variety of genetic tools  . Therefore, B. subtilis is widely used as an effective vaccine delivery system to induce mucosal immune responses and shows unique effect on the immune system.In the present report, we explored the immune effect of a recombinant B. subtilis (B. subtilis-RC) which had been successfully constructed with expressing PEDV COE protein in piglets.\",\n",

P-values less than 0.05 (P<0.05) were considered significant and P-values less than 0.01 (P<0.01) as highly significant.PPs are a concentrate of lymphoid tissue and the primary site for immunoglobulin A (IgA) production which is crucial to regulate the homeostatic balance of intestine  . The area of PPs is a key immunity indicator. Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC significantly (P<0.01) increased the area of PPs compared with two control groups as shown in Figure 1A .\",\n",
       "  'In addition, the villi length of ileum got longer by oral administration with B. subtilis-RC (P<0.01) than the other two groups ( Figure 1B) . These primarily confirmed that B. subtilis-RC was beneficial to maintain the structure of intestine.Intestinal IELs are a large and diverse population of lymphoid cells residing within the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and forming the intestinal mucosal barrier  . IELs are important part of the gut mucosal immune system. The level of specific anti-PEDV ileum IgA + secreting (SIgA) antibody in piglets was measured by ELISA in the mouth and feces. As shown in Figure 3A ,B, antigen-specific mucosal SIgA in the above sites was clearly higher than inactivated PEDV group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). As expected, the mouth had higher levels of SIgA than other sites. After oral immunization, the level of serum anti-PEDV IgG antibody in piglets immunized with B. subtilis-RC, inactivated PEDV or PBS were determined by ELISA, as shown in Figure 3C .',\n",
       "  'The results indicated that although the titers dropped during sampling period, the IgG level of B. subtilis-RC still significantly increased from 0 to 33 days than inactivated PEDV group (P<0.05 or P<0.01).CD3 + T lymphocytes are the fundamental cell surface markers of T lymphocytes, therefore, the number of CD3 + T lymphocytes could represent the quantity of T lymphocytes. Consequently, we analyzed the number of CD3 + T lymphocytes in ileum. The data indicated that both B. subtilis-RC and inactivated PEDV could dramatically (P<0.05) increase CD3 + T lymphocytes compared with PBS group ( Figure 4A ). These changes showed confident evidence that oral administration with B. subtilis-RC had a good influence on intestinal mucosal immunity in piglets.SIgA is the main immunoglobulin isotype in animals, largely secreted across the intestinal mucosal surface especially in the small intestine  . SIgA plays an important role in intestinal mucosal immunity and reflects on the intestinal mucosal immunity.',\n",
       "  'After oral administration with B. subtilis-RC, the number of IgA secreting cells had quickly risen compared with the other two groups (P<0.05) ( Figure 4B) . These results showed that oral administration with B. subtilis-RC was conducive to intestinal mucosal immunity and could increase the number of IgA secreting cells to produce positive effects on against PEDV infection.A great deal of immune cells are scattered in the epithelial cells. IECs indirectly or directly interact with innate and adaptive immune cells by presenting antigens to lymphocytes  . Consequently, learning about how the lymphocytes are distributed in the small intestinal mucosa is very meaningful for mucosal immunology. Previous data had shown that CD3 + T lymphocytes significantly (P<0.05) increased ( Figure 4A ), so we further analyzed the immunological classification of CD3 + T lymphocytes. The lymphocyte of the ileum with PPs junction was isolated and the lymphocytes of CD3, CD4, and CD8 were analyzed by three colors flow cytometry ( Figure 5A ).',\n",
       "  'These results showed that CD3 + CD4 + T cells have obviously (P<0.01) increased ( Figure 5B ), nevertheless the CD3 + CD8 + T cells remarkably (P<0.05) declined ( Figure 5C ). After calculation, the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells increased ( Figure 5D ). This ratio could also further measure the immunity levels of piglets. Cytokine IL-1β and IL-10 levels were determined to evaluate cellular immune responses induced by B. subtilis-RC as shown in Figure 6A ,B. As we can see from the diagram, significantly (P<0.01) higher IL-1β and IL-10 were produced after oral administration with B. subtilis-RC than the other two groups. These all revealed that B. subtilis-RC could stimulate cytokines release to mediate communication with and between cells of the immune system, improving the mucosal immune response to PEDV infection. The PEDV neutralizing antibodies were detected by PRNT assay.',\n",
       "  'Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC could effectively reduce the plaque-forming ability of PEDV (P<0.01) compared with other two groups in Figure 7 . This revealed that B. subtilis-RC could stimulate high level of PEDV neutralizing antibodies against PEDV infection.Amidst the PEDV outbreak, various vaccines have been developed to control diseases and the effects are unsatisfactory. Oral vaccines can induce more robust mucosal immunity than injectable counterparts  . Therefore, oral immunization has appeared as an effective strategy for controlling PEDV outbreak  .It is now clear that effective mucosal immune response requires serum IgG and mucosal SIgA  . SIgA is the basis of the mucosal immune system, playing an important role in maintaining the immune homeostasis, and neutralizing the invasive pathogens. Serum IgG represents systemic immune responses. During PEDV infections, oral immunization elicits not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses very well  .',\n",
       "  'Our data showed a strong and long-lasting anti-PEDV IgG response were detected by oral administration with B. subtilis-RC in piglets. Although as time went on, the antibody titers declined a little, it still stayed on overhead compared with control groups and with accordance to the changeable tendency of antibodies. The change of specific IgA showed similar results in mouth and feces mucosa. All these changes had contributed to fight PEDV infection. As the extra immunity boost, B. subtilis-RC reduced the ability of pathogens to cross the intestinal mucosa and the systemic spread of invasive pathogens  . The mucosal immune system generates immune responses through immune cells that reside in mucosal compartments. T lymphocytes residing in the mucosa play important roles in mucosal immunity  . We further explored the species, amounts, and distribution of T lymphocytes in the intestine mucosa. CD3 is a fundamental cell surface marker of T lymphocytes  .',\n",
       "  'The result showed that the number of CD3 + T lymphocytes significantly increased, and these revealed that B. subtilis-RC could stimulate T-cell maturation. According to the molecules expressed on the cell surface, T lymphocytes can further divide into T helper cells (CD4 + T cells) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8 + T cells)  . Furthermore, we observed that the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells increased by oral administration. The CD4/CD8 ratio measures the ratio of T helper cells to cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, we could see that oral administration B. subtilis-RC could strengthen Th1 immune response by raising the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells.Small intestine morphology can directly reflect the intestinal health and plays an important role in maintaining the intestine immune system  . The early stage of PEDV infection is frequently accompanied by necrosis and exfoliation of infected villous epithelial cells, ultimately resulting in acute, severe villous atrophy  .',\n",
       "  'Therefore, the effective work of maintaining intestine morphology is a good indicator for assessing the efficacy of vaccines. After oral administration with B. subtilis-RC, we found the area of PPs expanded significantly. PPs are small masses of lymphatic tissue and form an important part of the immune system by recruiting and inducting the T cells to prevent the growth of pathogens in the intestines. Furthermore, an increase in the number of IELs demonstrated the effectiveness of B. subtilis-RC. Moreover, the villi length of ileum showed some encouraging results that a well-formed intestine morphology came into being by B. subtilis-RC. The satisfactory intestine morphology was the first step on the road against PEDV infection. Several morphology results proved that B. subtilis-RC could remarkably maintain the intestine morphology and form comprehensive protection.As previously mentioned, oral administration with B. subtilis-RC could stimulate T-cell proliferation and differentiation and modulate the immune response.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, cytokines are small-molecule proteins with wide biological activity, synthesized and secreted by immune cells and some non-immune cells  . As a cell signaling molecule, it mainly acts to regulate immune responses, participating in the differentiation and development of immune cells, mediating inflammatory responses, stimulating hematopoiesis, and participating in tissue repair. Previous studies had demonstrated that PEDV inhibited both NF-κB and pro-inflammatory cytokines  . Therefore, cytokines are a key indicator for evaluating the ability of a vaccine to stimulate immune responses. In this study, we had observed that IL-1β and IL-10 increased (P<0.01) remarkably. IL-1β as one of the earliest pro-inflammatory cytokines and is centrally involved in the initiation and regulation of inflammatory and innate immune responses. Research had shown that IL-1β could significantly up-regulate the local and systemic immune tissues post microbial infection  . In addition, IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays an essential role in preventing inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies  .',\n",
       "  ' In summary, both data showed that oral administration with B. subtilis-RC regulated and enhanced immunity by up-regulating cytokines IL-1β and IL-10.In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that oral immunization with B. subtilis-RC could effectively induce local mucosal and systematic immune responses against PEDV infection, while enhancing and regulating the immune function by raising the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and cytokines IL-1β and IL-10, thus pointing to a promising oral vaccine candidate for PEDV infection in piglets.'],\n",

       "  \"Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.Another key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies.\",\n",
       "  'There was extensive criticism of China for its perceived failure to share information about the emerging SARS infection early enough in the outbreak to allow countries to prepare and respond. There were similar concerns about information sharing as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged and evolved in the Middle East in 2012, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and about the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014.On this occasion information sharing seems to have been rapid and effective (while recognising that the information available in the early stages of an outbreak is always less than the global community would like). The WHO was notified of the original clustering within days and the full genomic sequence of the new virus was published less than 2 weeks after the cluster was first detected.',\n",
       "  \"The WHO has expressed its satisfaction with the actions of the Chinese authorities in sharing information with the WHO.Working with journalists and the media to help them understand the science and epidemiology, particularly in a fast moving event, will improve risk communication to the public and reduce inappropriate concerns and panic.While reporting of this outbreak shows signs of the efforts of epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, national and international public health agencies and others engaging with journalists, there are also signs that this is not yet achieving it's goal. For example, the public perception is that the increase in case numbers reported daily by the Chinese authorities represents a daily escalation in the epidemic while the reality is that these numbers are also the result of active, aggressive, case finding in China and some of these cases are 'old' cases newly recognised as being due to the novel coronavirus.\",\n",
       "  \"Similarly the virus is usually described by the media as 'deadly' and although this is true in the sense that it has caused deaths, the nuances of uncertain case fatality rates in the early stages of an outbreak are not being communicated. The current estimated case fatality rate seems to be around 3% which is significant but not comparable to the 10% rate for SARS or 34% reported for MERS. These misperceptions are still driving public anxiety.To supplement formal reporting mechanisms between countries and with WHO (including the IHR), the use of informal mechanisms such as media and social media reports was advocated in the light of the SARS experience. There are now globally several systems that provide collated information from informal reporting including networks of experts and scanning of media and social media.\",\n",
       "  'These contribute to, and amplify, epidemic intelligence and are being integrated with national and international surveillance systems.The value, and the challenges, of this additional source of information has been evident in the current outbreak. The value comes from ensuring that early indications of cases beyond the initial outbreak city have been detected and can supplement the global risk assessment and monitoring of the evolution of the outbreak. The challenges lie in the volume and diversity of the information available and the relative lack of verification mechanisms, such that one of these systems (ProMed) has commented that it was becoming increasingly difficult to assimilate the information being supplied  and to make meaningful interpretations.Early in the outbreak it was reported that health workers had not been infected. This was reassuring because it is health workers who many times, and inadvertently, amplify transmission.',\n",
       "  \"Failure to wash hands between patients, for example, can result not only in autoinfection, but also in infection of patients hospitalised for other causes when they provide care. Autoinfection is not only a risk for the health worker, but also for their families and the communities in which they live, depending on the transmissibility and means of transmission. More recently infection, and at least one death, in health workers has been confirmed. Although not unexpected this does add to the epidemiological risk.A characteristic of the SARS outbreak was the variability of transmissibility between cases and the occurrence of 'superspreading events' where a case infected significantly more contacts than the average. This was also seen with MERS in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea (RoK). In this current novel coronavirus outbreak, such superspreading events have not been documented but the epidemiology is still not clear.\",\n",
       "  \"Confirming whether or not this is happening must be an urgent task for the Chinese investigation. Modellers have suggested reproductive rates (R 0 ) of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0)  and 2.6 (1.5-3.5)  ; R 0 for SARS was estimated at around 3 in the absence of control measures  .The economic impact of major outbreaks can be substantial for the affected country. This was seen clearly in SARS, MERS in RoK and Ebola in West Africa. One analyst estimates that the current coronavirus outbreak's likely impact will range from a 0.8% cut to real GDP if the epidemic is controlled within 3 months, to a 1.9% cost to GDP if the epidemic lasts 9 months  . This may increase substantially in the light of the extended restrictions on movement, and therefore trade and commerce, within China.The emergence of a significant respiratory illness linked to a novel coronavirus represents a test of the global capacity to detect and mange emerging disease threats.\",\n",
       "  'Its emergence in China adds an additional dimension in the light of previous experience with SARS. The timing of the outbreak immediately before the Chinese Lunar New Year with its attendant population movements adds extra risk and urgency to the response.The rapid sharing of information in this outbreak and the speed of the coordinated response both in the country and internationally suggest that lessons have been learned from SARS that improve global capacity. The international networks and forums that now exist have facilitated the bringing together of expertise from around the world to focus research and development efforts and maximise the impact.At this early stage in the outbreak information remains incomplete and key clinical and epidemiological questions have not yet been answered, but the deficit seems to be due more to the constraints of investigating an emerging disease than to any unwillingness to engage and share information with partners.There are some indications of areas where further improvement is necessary.',\n",
       "  'The global media response to the unfolding events has been relatively balanced and informed but the nuances of the evolving situation have not been critically examined in partnership with the media and as a result the public perception of the risk may be exaggeratedalthough it of course remains possible that the outbreak will develop in a way that matches up to the perceived risk. The lack of appreciation of the uncertainties in determining a meaningful case fatality rate and the significance of ascertainment bias at the beginning of an outbreak, along with the impact of aggressive case finding on case numbers, are examples of where understanding could be improved. This is always a challenging process when balancing the resources focussed on analysing the situation on the ground with resources directed at interpreting the information for journalists but in SARS, the R 0 was seen to decrease in response to information reaching the public and the public then adopting risk reduction actions  ; so accurate public risk communication is critical to success.',\n",
       "  'It would be helpful to find a forum where this can be explored with the media community after the event.The increase in access to early information from diverse sources including media and social media adds an important dimension to identifying and tracking new events globally and is a key part of the overall epidemic intelligence system. However, it is also a potential source of disinformation. When, as has been seen in this outbreak, the volume of information coming in exceeds any capacity to collate and analyse it and to attempt to cross-reference and verify separate items, there is a risk that the information fuels speculation and media and public concern. Again there is a fine balance between information that encourages appropriate risk avoidance actions and information that encourages inappropriate actions; however the public health is usually better served by more information rather than less.The role of a declaration of a PHEIC in managing a serious outbreak has been questioned in the light of Ebola in West Africa and in the Democratic Republic of Congo  and has been challenged again with this outbreak.',\n",
       "  \"The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration (either an event is a PHEIC or it isn'tthere are no intermediate options) and the specificity of the three defined criteria for a PHEIC have caused difficulty for Emergency Committees in considering whether a given event should be a PHEIC. The lack of a clear understanding of what a PHEIC declaration is meant to achieve adds to the Emergency Committee's difficulties, as does the relative paucity of clinical and epidemiological answers at this stage of the investigation. In this instance the Emergency Committee were divided in coming to a conclusion but decided on balance that the current situation, although an emergency, should not as yet be declared a PHEIC .\",\n",
       "  \"As with Ebola in the DRC, there has been criticism of the WHO for this decision but, as with Ebola, it is not immediately clear what would be different in the response if a PHEIC was declared.The WHO is working on improving the way in which Emergency Committees develop their advice for the Director General but, as recommended by this Emergency Committee and the post-Ebola IHR Review Committee in 2015, the development of an intermediate alert alongside WHO's risk assessment process may be helpful.A key function of a PHEIC declaration is that it is the (only) gateway to the WHO Temporary Recommendations on possible travel and trade restrictions to limit international spread of a disease. In this case several countries globally had already implemented entry screening at airports and China had begun closing down international travel from Wuhan before the Emergency Committee had finished their deliberations.\",\n",
       "  'While the WHO would not, and could not, interfere with the sovereign decisions of member states, the lack of influence on travel and trade decisions could prove problematic.Alongside the speed of the response in this outbreak, we have seen dramatic changes in the scale of the response. The imposition of very extensive quarantine measures on millions of people as an attempt to break the transmission of the virus is unprecedented. We do not know whether they will be effective; indeed we do not know how we will determine if they have been effectivewhat end point can we measure that will provide an answer to that question?',\n",
       "  'If recent suggestions that people infected with this coronavirus may be infectious while incubating or asymptomatic, and the reports that up to 5 m people left Wuhan before the travel restrictions were imposed, are confirmed, the efficacy of these control measures will be more challenged.Given the likely impact on at least the Chinese economy and probably the global economy, it will be important to understand the role and the effectiveness of public health measures on this scale for the future.However, the imposition of these dramatic measures does also raise a wider question: if there is an impact from these measures, what other countries would (or could) implement such measures? Would other countries accept the self-imposed economic damage that China has accepted to try and contain this outbreak?',\n",
       "  \"Is it reasonable to consider that national governments would close down public transport into and out of London, New York or Paris in the week before Christmas even if it were shown to be an effective control measure?These decisions and questions cross the interface between public health, science and politics. The response to this outbreak inChina was inevitably influenced by the historical reaction to the country's response to SARS and the world's suspicion of China's lack of cooperation at that time. The current response is therefore framed within a context of not wanting to be seen to be behaving in the same way with this event.This may indicate another impact of the SARS (and MERS and Ebola) experience on the response to subsequent outbreaksa tendency to look at worst case scenarios and respond accordingly and a fear of 'getting it wrong'.\",\n",
       "  \"This can deter leaders at all levels, from outbreak teams to national governments, from making judgements when all the information they would like is not available in case those judgments turn out to be wrong when the full information becomes available.In emergency response it is generally better to over-react and then scale back if necessary rather than under-react and then act too late. Response should be on a 'no regrets' basismake the best decisions possible on the basis of the best information and science available at the time but do not judge or criticise if later information suggests a different course of action. The early response must recognise what is known and what is not known and look at what of the unknowns can reasonably be estimated by reference to previous outbreaks, similar pathogens, early reporting and modelling, etc.\",\n",
       "  'The risk assessment and response can then be modified and refined as information on the unknowns evolves.Key to that approach, however, is confidence that decisions will not be criticised based on information that was not available at the time. It is also important to be ready to change decisions when the available information changessomething that both scientists and politicians can find difficult.In that context, China should not be judged for implementing what might appear to be extreme measures but China should also be prepared to discontinue the measures quickly if evidence suggests they are not the best way to solve the problem. By closing airports the international spread from Wuhan may be decreased, but success will depend on how effective the measures really are at stopping people moving out of the affected area as well as on the behaviour of the virus. As always, only time will tellbut time is scarce.'],\n",
       " ['Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include vaccines and antivirals. Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly upregulated, including the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to influenza A PR8 (H1N1) virus, suggesting a key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies.Text: Influenza viruses cause acute and highly contagious seasonal respiratory disease in all age groups.',\n",
       "  'Between 3-5 million cases of severe influenza-related illness and over 250 000 deaths are reported every year. In addition to constant seasonal outbreaks, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains, such as H5N1, remain an ongoing pandemic threat with recent WHO figures showing 454 confirmed laboratory infections and a mortality rate of 53%. It is important to note that humans have very little pre-existing immunity towards avian influenza virus strains. Moreover, there is no commercially available human H5N1 vaccine. Given the potential for H5N1 viruses to trigger a pandemic 1,2 , there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to combat known deficiencies in our ability to control outbreaks. Current seasonal influenza virus prophylactic and therapeutic strategies involve the use of vaccination and antivirals. Vaccine efficacy is highly variable as evidenced by a particularly severe 2017/18 epidemic, and frequent re-formulation of the vaccine is required to combat ongoing mutations in the influenza virus genome.',\n",
       "  'In addition, antiviral resistance has been reported for many circulating strains, including the avian influenza H7N9 virus that emerged in 2013 3, 4 . Influenza A viruses have also been shown to target and hijack multiple host cellular pathways to promote survival and replication 5, 6 . As such, there is increasing evidence to suggest that targeting host pathways will influence virus replication, inflammation, immunity and pathology 5, 7 . Alternative intervention strategies based on modulation of the host response could be used to supplement the current prophylactic and therapeutic protocols.While the impact of influenza virus infection has been relatively well studied in animal models 8, 9 , human cellular responses are poorly defined due to the lack of available human autopsy material, especially from HPAI virus-infected patients. In the present study, we characterized influenza virus infection of primary human alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells isolated from normal human lung tissue donated by patients undergoing lung resection.',\n",
       "  'ATII cells are a physiologically relevant infection model as they are a main target for influenza A viruses when entering the respiratory tract 10 . Human host gene expression following HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Chicken/ Vietnam/0008/04) infection of primary ATII cells was analyzed using Illumina HiSeq deep sequencing. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying modulation of host immunity in an anti-inflammatory environment, we also analyzed changes in gene expression following HPAI H5N1 infection in the presence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, apocynin, a compound known to interfere with NADPH oxidase subunit assembly 5, 6 .The HiSeq analysis described herein has focused on differentially regulated genes following H5N1 infection. Several criteria were considered when choosing a \"hit\" for further study. These included: (1) Novelty; has this gene been studied before in the context of influenza virus infection/pathogenesis?',\n",
       "  '(2) Immunoregulation; does this gene have a regulatory role in host immune responses so that it has the potential to be manipulated to improve immunity? (3) Therapeutic reagents; are there any existing commercially available therapeutic reagents, such as specific inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies that can be utilized for in vitro and in vivo study in order to optimize therapeutic strategies? (4) Animal models; is there a knock-out mouse model available for in vivo influenza infection studies? Based on these criteria, carcinoembryonic-antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) was chosen as a key gene of interest. CEACAM1 (also known as BGP or CD66) is expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells 11 , as well as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)    . Human CEACAM1 has been shown to act as a receptor for several human bacterial and fungal pathogens, including Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans, but has not as yet been implicated in virus entry    .',\n",
       "  'There is however emerging evidence to suggest that CEACAM1 is involved in host immunity as enhanced expression in lymphocytes was detected in pregnant women infected with cytomegalovirus 18 and in cervical tissue isolated from patients with papillomavirus infection 19 .Eleven CEACAM1 splice variants have been reported in humans 20 . CEACAM1 isoforms (Uniprot P13688-1 to -11) can differ in the number of immunoglobulin-like domains present, in the presence or absence of a transmembrane domain and/or the length of their cytoplasmic tail (i.e. L, long or S, short). The full-length human CEACAM1 protein (CEACAM1-4L) consists of four extracellular domains (one extracellular immunoglobulin variable-region-like (IgV-like) domain and three immunoglobulin constant region 2-like (IgC2-like) domains), a transmembrane domain, and a long (L) cytoplasmic tail. The long cytoplasmic tail contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that are absent in the short form 20 . The most common isoforms expressed by human immune cells are CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-3L 21 .',\n",
       "  'CEACAM1 interacts homophilically with itself 22 or heterophilically with CEACAM5 (a related CEACAM family member) 23 . The dimeric state allows recruitment of signaling molecules such as SRC-family kinases, including the tyrosine phosphatase SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) and SHP2 members to phosphorylate ITIMs 24 . As such, the presence or absence of ITIMs in CEACAM1 isoforms influences signaling properties and downstream cellular function. CEACAM1 homophilic or heterophilic interactions and ITIM phosphorylation are critical for many biological processes, including regulation of lymphocyte function, immunosurveillance, cell growth and differentiation 25, 26 and neutrophil activation and adhesion to target cells during inflammatory responses 27 . It should be noted that CEACAM1 expression has been modulated in vivo using an anti-CEACAM1 antibody (MRG1) to inhibit CEACAM1-positive melanoma xenograft growth in SCID/NOD mice 28 . MRG1 blocked CEACAM1 homophilic interactions that inhibit T cell effector function, enhancing the killing of CEACAM1+ melanoma cells by T cells 28 .',\n",
       "  'This highlights a potential intervention pathway that can be exploited in other disease processes, including virus infection. In addition, Ceacam1-knockout mice are available for further in vivo infection studies.Our results show that CEACAM1 mRNA and protein expression levels were highly elevated following HPAI H5N1 infection. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of CEACAM1 reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and more importantly, inhibited H5N1 virus replication in primary human ATII cells and in the continuous human type II respiratory epithelial A549 cell line. Taken together, these observations suggest that CEACAM1 is an attractive candidate for modulating influenza-specific immunity. In summary, our study has identified a novel target that may influence HPAI H5N1 immunity and serves to highlight the importance of manipulating host responses as a way of improving disease outcomes in the context of virus infection.Three experimental groups were included in the HiSeq analysis of H5N1 infection in the presence or absence of the ROS inhibitor, apocynin: (i) uninfected cells treated with 1% DMSO (vehicle control) (ND), (ii) H5N1-infected cells treated with 1% DMSO (HD) and (iii) H5N1-infected cells treated with 1 mM apocynin dissolved in DMSO (HA).',\n",

HiSeq was performed on samples and reads mapped to the human genome where they were then assembled into transcriptomes for differential expression analysis. A total of 13,649 genes were identified with FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) > 1 in at least one of the three experimental groups. A total of 623 genes were significantly upregulated and 239 genes were significantly downregulated (q value < 0.05, ≥2-fold change) following H5N1 infection (ND vs. HD) ( Fig. 1A ; Table S1 ).',\n",

Whilst a subset of genes was differentially expressed in both the HD and HA groups, either being upregulated (247 genes, Fig. 1D ) or downregulated (146 genes, Fig. 1E ), a majority of genes did not in fact overlap between the HD and HA groups (Fig.',\n",

The 55 genes include those involved in influenza A immunity (hsa05164; DDX58, IFIH1, IFNB1, MYD88, PML, STAT2), Jak-STAT signaling (hsa04630; IFNB1, IL15RA, IL22RA1, STAT2), RIG-I-like receptor signaling (hsa04622; DDX58, IFIH1, IFNB1) and Antigen processing and presentation (hsa04612; TAP2, TAP1, HLA-DOB) (Tables S3 and S4) . Therefore, critical immune responses induced following H5N1 infection were not dampened following apocynin treatment. The remaining 190 of 245 genes were not present in the \"ND vs. HA Up\" list, suggesting that those genes were significantly inhibited by apocynin to a level that was similar to uninfected control cells (Fig.',\n",

The CEACAM1 transcript was significantly upregulated following H5N1 infection (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, a related member of the CEACAM family, CEACAM5, was not affected by H5N1 infection (Fig.',\n",
       "  '3B) . It is also worth noting that more reads were obtained for CEACAM5 (>1000 FPKM) (Fig. 3B ) than CEACAM1 (~7 FPKM) (Fig. 3A) in uninfected ATII cells, which is consistent with their normal expression patterns in human lung tissue 32 . Therefore, although CEACAM1 forms heterodimers with CEACAM5 23 , the higher basal expression of CEACAM5 in ATII cells may explain why its expression was not enhanced by H5N1 infection. Endogenous CEACAM1 protein expression was also analyzed in uninfected or influenza virus-infected A549 (Fig. 3C ) and ATII cells (Fig. 3D ). CEACAM1 protein expression was slightly, but not significantly, increased in A549 cells infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) virus for 24 or 48 hours when compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 3C ). No significant difference in CEACAM1 protein levels were observed at various MOIs (2, 5 or 10) or between the 24 and 48 hpi timepoints (Fig.',\n",
       "  '3C) .After examing CEACAM1 protein expression following infection with PR8 virus in A549 cells, CEACAM1 protein expression was then examined in primary human ATII cells infected with HPAI H5N1 and compared to PR8 virus infection (Fig. 3D) . ATII cells were infected with PR8 virus at a MOI of 2, a dose that induced upregulation of cytokines and influenza Matrix (M) gene analyzed by qRT-PCR (data not shown). Lower MOIs of 0.5, 1 and 2 of HPAI H5N1 were tested due to the strong cytopathogenic effect H5N1 causes at higher MOIs. Endogenous CEACAM1 protein levels were significantly and similarly elevated in H5N1-infected ATII cells at the three MOIs tested. CEACAM1 protein expression in ATII cells infected with H5N1 at MOIs of 0.5 were higher at 48 hpi than those observed at 24 hpi (Fig. 3D ).',\n",
       "  'HPAI H5N1 virus infection at MOIs of 0.5, 1 and 2 stimulated higher endogenous levels of CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to PR8 virus infection at a MOI of 2 at the corresponding time point (a maximum ~9-fold increase induced by H5N1 at MOIs of 0.5 and 1 at 48 hpi when compared to PR8 at MOI of 2), suggesting a possible role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity (Fig. 3D ).In order to understand the role of CEACAM1 in influenza pathogenesis, A549 and ATII cells were transfected with siCEACAM1 to knockdown endogenous CEACAM1 protein expression. ATII and A549 cells were transfected with siCEACAM1 or siNeg negative control. The expression of four main CEACAM1 variants, CEACAM1-4L, -4S, -3L and -3S, and CEACAM1 protein were analyzed using SYBR Green qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.',\n",
       "  'SYBR Green qRT-PCR analysis showed that ATII cells transfected with 15 pmol of siCEACAM1 significantly reduced the expression of CEACAM1-4L and -4S when compared to siNeg control, while the expression of CEACAM1-3L and -3S was not altered (Fig. 4A ). CEACAM1 protein expression was reduced by approximately 50% in both ATII and A549 cells following siCEACAM1 transfection when compared with siNeg-transfected cells (Fig. 4B) . Increasing doses of siCEACAM1 (10, 15 and 20 pmol) did not further downregulate CEACAM1 protein expression in A549 cells (Fig. 4B ). As such, 15 pmol of siCEACAM1 was chosen for subsequent knockdown studies in both ATII and A549 cells. It is important to note that the anti-CEACAM1 antibody only detects L isoforms based on epitope information provided by Abcam. Therefore, observed reductions in CEACAM1 protein expression can be attributed mainly to the abolishment of CEACAM1-4L.The functional consequences of CEACAM1 knockdown were then examined in ATII and A549 cells following H5N1 infection.',\n",
       "  'IL6, IFNB1, CXCL10, CCL5 and TNF production was analyzed in H5N1-infected ATII and A549 cells using qRT-PCR. ATII (Fig. 5A ) and A549 cells (Fig. 5B) transfected with siCEACAM1 showed significantly lower expression of IL6, CXCL10 and CCL5 when compared with siNeg-transfected cells. However, the expression of the anti-viral cytokine, IFNB1, was not affected in both cells types. In addition, TNF expression, which can be induced by type I IFNs 33 , was significantly lower in siCEACAM1-transfected A549 cells (Fig. 5B) , but was not affected in siCEACAM1-transfected ATII cells (Fig. 5A) . Hypercytokinemia or \"cytokine storm\" in H5N1 and H7N9 virus-infected patients is thought to contribute to inflammatory tissue damage 34, 35 . Downregulation of CEACAM1 in the context of severe viral infection may reduce inflammation caused by H5N1 infection without dampening the antiviral response. Furthermore, virus replication was significantly reduced by 5.2-fold in ATII (Figs.',\n",
       "  '5C) and 4.8-fold in A549 cells (Fig. 5D ) transfected with siCEACAM1 when compared with siNeg-transfected cells. Virus titers in siNeg-transfected control cells were not significantly different from those observed in mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 5C,D) . Influenza viruses utilize host cellular machinery to manipulate normal cell processes in order to promote replication and evade host immune responses. Studies in the field are increasingly focused on understanding and modifying key host factors in order to ameliorate disease. Examples include modulation of ROS to reduce inflammation 5 and inhibition of NFκB and mitogenic Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade activation to suppress viral replication 36, 37 . These host targeting strategies will offer an alternative to current interventions that are focused on targeting the virus. In the present study, we analyzed human host gene expression profiles following HPAI H5N1 infection and treatment with the antioxidant, apocynin.',\n",
       "  'As expected, genes that were significantly upregulated following H5N1 infection were involved in biological processes, including cytokine signaling, immunity and apoptosis. In addition, H5N1-upregulated genes were also involved in regulation of protein phosphorylation, cellular metabolism and cell proliferation, which are thought to be exploited by viruses for replication 38 . Apocynin treatment had both anti-viral (Tables S2-S4) 5 and pro-viral impact (Fig. 2G) , which is not surprising as ROS are potent microbicidal agents, as well as important immune signaling molecules at different concentrations 39 . In our hands, apocynin treatment reduced H5N1-induced inflammation, but also impacted the cellular defense response, cytokine production and cytokine-mediated signaling. Importantly, critical antiviral responses were not compromised, i.e. expression of pattern recognition receptors (e.g. DDX58 (RIG-I), TLRs, IFIH1 (MDA5)) was not downregulated (Table S1 ). Given the significant interference of influenza viruses on host immunity, we focused our attention on key regulators of the immune response.',\n",
       "  'Through HiSeq analysis, we identified the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 as a critical regulator of immunity. Knockdown of endogenous CEACAM1 inhibited H5N1 virus replication and reduced H5N1-stimulated inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. H5N1 infection resulted in significant upregulation of a number of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines genes, including AXL and STING, which were significantly reduced by apocynin treatment to a level lower than that observed in uninfected cells (Table S4) . It has been previously demonstrated that anti-AXL antibody treatment of PR8-infected mice significantly reduced lung inflammation and virus titers 40 . STING has been shown to be important for promoting anti-viral responses, as STING-knockout THP-1 cells produce less type I IFN following influenza A virus infection 41 . Reduction of STING gene expression or other anti-viral factors (e.g. IFNB1, MX1, ISG15; Table S1 ) by apocynin, may in part, explain the slight increase in influenza gene transcription following apocynin treatment (Fig. 2G) .',\n",
       "  'These results also suggest that apocynin treatment may reduce H5N1-induced inflammation and apoptosis. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of apocynin have been shown previously in a number of disease models, including diabetes mellitus 42 , myocardial infarction 43 , neuroinflammation 44 and influenza virus infection 6 .Recognition of intracellular viral RNA by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that recruit innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and NK cells, to the site of infection to assist in viral clearance 45 . Neutrophils exert their cytotoxic function by first attaching to influenza-infected epithelial cells via adhesion molecules, such as CEACAM1 46 . Moreover, studies have indicated that influenza virus infection promotes neutrophil apoptosis 47 , delaying virus elimination 48 . Phosphorylation of CEACAM1 ITIM motifs and activation of caspase-3 is critical for mediating anti-apoptotic events and for promoting survival of neutrophils 27 .',\n",
       "  'This suggests that CEACAM1-mediated anti-apoptotic events may be important for the resolution of influenza virus infection in vivo, which can be further investigated through infection studies with Ceacam1-knockout mice.NK cells play a critical role in innate defense against influenza viruses by recognizing and killing infected cells. Influenza viruses, however, employ several strategies to escape NK effector functions, including modification of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation to avoid NK activating receptor binding 49 . Homo-or heterophilic CEACAM1 interactions have been shown to inhibit NK-killing 25, 26 , and are thought to contribute to tumor cell immune evasion 50 . Given these findings, one could suggest the possibility that upregulation of CEACAM1 (to inhibit NK activity) may be a novel and uncharacterized immune evasion strategy employed by influenza viruses. Our laboratory is now investigating the role of CEACAM1 in NK cell function. Small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases or protein phosphatases (e.g.',\n",
       "  'inhibitors for Src, JAK, SHP2) have been developed as therapies for cancer, inflammation, immune and metabolic diseases 51 . Modulation of CEACAM1 phosphorylation, dimerization and the downstream function with small-molecule inhibitors may assist in dissecting the contribution of CEACAM1 to NK cell activity.The molecular mechanism of CEACAM1 action following infection has also been explored in A549 cells using PR8 virus 52 . Vitenshtein et al. demonstrated that CEACAM1 was upregulated following recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I, and that this upregulation was interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent. In addition, phosphorylation of CEACAM1 by SHP2 inhibited viral replication by reducing phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to suppress global cellular protein production. In the present study, we used a more physiologically relevant infection model, primary human ATII cells, to study the role of Further studies will be required to investigate/confirm the molecular mechanisms of CEACAM1 upregulation following influenza virus infection, especially in vivo.',\n",
       "  'As upregulation of CEACAM1 has been observed in other virus infections, such as cytomegalovirus 18 and papillomavirus 19 , it will be important to determine whether a common mechanism of action can be attributed to CEACAM1 in order to determine its functional significance. If this can be established, CEACAM1 could be used as a target for the development of a pan-antiviral agent.In summary, molecules on the cell surface such as CEACAM1 are particularly attractive candidates for therapeutic development, as drugs do not need to cross the cell membrane in order to be effective. Targeting of host-encoded genes in combination with current antivirals and vaccines may be a way of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infection. Our study clearly demonstrates that increased CEACAM1 expression is observed in primary human ATII cells infected with HPAI H5N1 influenza virus.',\n",

       " ['Enfuvirtide (T20), is the first HIV fusion inhibitor approved for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients who fail to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs. However, its clinical application is limited because of short half-life, drug resistance and cross-reactivity with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients. Using an artificial peptide strategy, we designed a peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, which exhibited potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20, and had remarkably longer in vivo half-life than T20. While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20’s antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices.',\n",

Some of these peptides have better inhibitory activities against T20-resistant strains and/or longer half-life than T20. However, they still have the problem to cross-react with the preexisting antibodies in the sera of HIV-infected patients because they contain some native CHR sequences. Based on the universal artificial peptide template of 5HRu, we previously designed the artificial peptides of AP1 (PBD-m4HR) and AP2 (PBDtrp-m4HR), and have made preliminary research on their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion 16 .

Particularly, the preexisting antibodies in the sera of HIV-infected patients did not suppress, but enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of AP3.

These results indicate that the artificial peptide AP3 has remarkably improved anti-HIV-1 activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including T20resistant variants, over T20 and the artificial peptides AP1 and AP2. The preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity.',\n",
       "  'Previous studies have shown that the preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients, including those cross-reacting with T20 and those specific for the binding sites of T20 in gp120 (e.g., the C1 and V3 loop regions) and gp41 (e.g., the NHR domain), could significantly block the fusion inhibitory activity of T20 14, 15 . Here we investigated the influence of preexisting antibodies against AP3 peptide. As shown in Fig. 2a , both T20 and C46 reacted with the antibodies in sera from five HIV-1-infected patients; however, none of the three artificial peptides AP1, AP2 and AP3 was recognized by the preexisting antibodies. The inhibitory activity of T20 on HIV-1 IIIB infection was reduced about 1.9-fold to > 3.6-fold in the presence of the sera from HIV-1-infected patients ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S1), confirming that the preexisting antibodies in sera of HIV/AIDS patients can attenuate the anti-HIV-1 activity of T20 14, 15 .',\n",
       "  \"However, none of the artificial peptides in the present study showed significant decrease of anti-HIV-1 activity in the presence of patients' sera. Instead, the antiviral activity of AP3 increased in the presence of antisera from HIV-1-infected patients ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that anti-HIV-1 antibodies actually enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of AP3, possibly because the binding of the antibodies to some sites in gp120 or gp41 promote the interaction of AP3 with viral gp41 NHR region.AP3 had longer half-life than T20. Although T20 has shown efficacy in inhibiting HIV-1 infection, its major weakness lies in its short half-life in plasma (about 2 h)    . As a result, T20 has to be administered subcutaneously twice daily at 90 mg per dose, often causing serious injection-site reactions 25, 26 . Here, we performed pharmacokinetic studies by intravenous administration of AP3, AP2, and T20, respectively, to SD rat at a dose of 1 mg/kg, in order to compare their in vivo circulation time.\",\n",
       "  'As expected, T20 exhibited a shorter half-life and lower AUC (0-t) from systemic circulation, while AP3 and AP2 demonstrated much higher concentration and longer circulation time ( Table 2 ). The pharmacokinetic profiles of AP3 and AP2 fit a non-compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with PK Solver. The in vivo elimination half-life of AP3 (t 1/2 = 6.02 h) was about 2.8-fold longer than that of T20 (t 1/2 = 1.57 h). This result provided the theoretical basis for reducing the injection frequency and dose of the fusion inhibitor, in conjugation with the improved antiviral potency of AP3. Therefore, replacement of T20 with AP3 may significantly reduce injection-site reactions and the drug cost, which would promote the clinical applications of the HIV fusion inhibitor in resource-poor regions or countries.AP3 was much more resistant than T20 to proteolytic degradation by proteinase K and rat liver homogenate.',\n",
       "  'We compared the stability of T20 and AP3 in the presence of proteinase K (a broad-spectrum serine proteinase) and rat liver homogenate. After treatment with 20 ng/mL of proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C, only 29% of the parental T20 peptide remained, as detected by LC-MS analysis. Under the same condition, AP3 retained 100% of its prototype (Fig. 3a ). In addition, AP3 showed a significantly enhanced in vitro metabolic stability over T20 in the presence of liver homogenate (Fig. 3b) .These results indicate that the artificial peptide AP3 is much more resistant to proteolytic degradation than the natural peptide T20, which may contribute to its significant longer in vivo half-life than T20 as described above.AP3 formed stable α-helical complex and block gp41 6-HB formation. To investigate the antiviral mechanism of AP3, the thermal stability of AP3/N36 complex was compared with that of AP1/N36, AP2/N36, T20/N36, and C34/N36 complexes by circular-dichroism (CD) spectroscopy 27 .',\n",
       "  'Because T20 lacks the pocket-binding domain (PBD), the T20/N36 complex did not show a typical α -helical conformation, in consistence with our previous studies 8, 9 . Similar to the α -helicity of C34/N36 complex 3 , the AP1/N36, AP2/N36 and AP3/N36 complexes all formed a saddle-shaped negative peak at 208 nm and 222 nm, indicating their α -helical structures (Fig. 4a) Fig. 4b) , indicating that the α -helical complex formed by AP3 and N36 is the most stable among the four complexes.Then we compared the inhibitory activity of AP3 with that of AP1 and AP2 on 6-HB formation between C34 and N36. Since T20 cannot block 6-HB formation 8, 9 , we used a small-molecule HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, ADS-J1 28, 29 , to replace T20 as a control of 6-HB inhibition. As expected, ADS-J1 could effectively inhibit 6-HB formation with IC 50 of 2.75 μ M 8, 9,    .',\n",
       "  'AP3 was highly effective against 6-HB formation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 0.24 μ M, about 30-and 15-fold more potent than AP1 and AP2, respectively (Fig. 4c) , confirming that AP3 can potently block gp41 6-HB fusion core formation, thus inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with the target cell membrane.Structural basis for the potent fusion inhibitory activity of the artificial peptide AP3. To elucidate the molecular determinants of these artificial peptides, we successfully solved all three complex structures of AP1/AP2/AP3 peptides binding with gp41 NHR. For AP1 and AP2, an optimized linker Each sample was tested in triplicate and the experiment was repeated twice. The data are presented as means ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. \"SGGRGG\" was used to assemble the NHR and the artificial peptide into a single recombinant protein (N36-L6-AP1 or N36-L6-AP2).',\n",
       "  'However, a similar strategy failed on the crystallization of AP3; therefore, we decided to cocrystallize the synthetic peptide N45 and AP3 peptide, and eventually the complex crystals were obtained. Interestingly, the crystals of three different inhibitors belong to three distinctive space groups: P2 1 for N36-L6-AP1, R32 for N36-L6-AP2, and P6 3 for N45/AP3. As expected, the NHR portions in three structures all form a trimeric core, while the AP1, AP2 or AP3 portion folds into a single-helix conformation and binds to NHR-trimer to form a typical 6-HB, similar to that of the HIV-1 gp41 core structure formed by the native CHR peptide C34 and N36 (Fig. 5a) . Also, the conserved hydrophobic residues, such as W43, W46 and I50, in the artificial peptides were deeply buried into the hydrophobic Table 2 .

The experiment was performed in triplicate and the data are presented as means ± SD. The inhibition of AP1, AP2, AP3, T20 and ADS-J1 against 6-HB formation between N36 and C34 was detected by ELISA using the 6-HB-specific mAb NC-1. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the data are presented as means ± SD. grooves formed between each pair of NHR helices, similar to the corresponding residues of W628, W631 and I635 in the native gp41 CHR (Fig. 5b) . AP peptides exhibited better affinity against gp41 natural CHR. In C34, which contains the natural CHR sequence from W628 to L661, no strong interaction between I642 and Q565 in the viral gp41 NHR-CHR complex was found (Fig.',\n",
       "  '5c) . However, in the corresponding sequence (from W43 to K76) of AP1 and AP2, a hydrogen bond was established between S57 (corresponding to I642 in CHR) and Q18 (corresponding to Q565 in NHR) in N36-L6-AP1, N36-L6-AP2 and N45/AP3. Thus, S57 in AP1/AP2/AP3 plays a role in stabilizing the interactions between the artificial peptide inhibitor and its NHR target, resulting in their stronger binding affinity. Moreover, in NHR-CHR, L567 and L568 on two adjacent NHRs form a hydrophobic groove, in which T639 is buried (Supplementary Fig. S1a ). However, in N36-L6-AP1, N36-L6-AP2 and N45/AP3, I54 (corresponding to T639 in CHR) can strongly bind to L20 and L21 through fully hydrophobic side chain interactions. Similarly, the interaction of I64 (corresponding to S659 in CHR) with L10 and L11 (corresponding to L567 and L568 in NHR, respectively) in N36-L6-AP1, N36-L6-AP2 and N45/AP3 has been significantly enhanced ( Supplementary Fig.',\n",
       "  'S1b ).Like the gp41 CHR helix, the helices of AP1, AP2 and AP3 also have two different sides, a hydrophobic side facing toward the NHR and a hydrophilic one facing outward. It is expected that the enhancement of the hydrophilicity of the exposed side of the inhibitors can increase their antiviral activity and solubility. To achieve this goal, the amino acid residues with hydrophobicity, or low hydrophilicity, like N637, S640, L641 and S644 in CHR, were changed to the amino acid residues with high hydrophilicity, like E52, K55, K56 and E59 in AP1, AP2 and AP3, respectively. Moreover, the hydrophobic residue M629 in CHR was replaced with a hydrophilic residue E44 in AP2 and AP3 ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). These hydrophilic residues, such as glutamic acid and lysine, can increase the solubility of whole peptide and, hence, stabilize the complex formed by the inhibitor and its target.',\n",
       "  'It has been proved that the EE-KK double salt bridge can stabilize helix conformation 30 . We have identified this kind of interaction between i and i + 3 or i + 4 positions on the three complex structures. In N36-L6-AP1, R48 interacts with E45 and E52 to form a salt bridge network. In N36-L6-AP2, E45 interacts with K48, and E52 binds to K56, while in N45/AP3, K69 binds to E66 ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). These strong salt bridges formed by the oppositely charged residues stabilize AP peptide conformation, bringing its inhibitory effect into full play.As previously reported, addition of the \"M-T hook\" to the CHR peptides C34 and sifuvertide could dramatically improve the anti-HIV-1 activity 17, 18 . As expected, the N-terminal Met and Thr of AP3 forms a hook-like structure (Fig. 5d) . The hydrophobic methionine side chain of M41 accommodates the groove between AP3 and NHR helices, capping the hydrophobic pocket.',\n",
       "  'This interaction leads to a series of conformational changes. The main chain of AP3 at W43 moves 1.91 Å closer to NHR compared to AP2 (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The side chain of W43 in AP3 flips around 90 degrees and is buried deeper than that of AP2. The side chain of E44 turns back to interact to D47, but the E45 side chain turns back from K48 and interacts with T42. Therefore, this M-T hook structure could further stabilize the binding between AP3 and NHR target.Enfuvirtide, also known as T20, was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first HIV entry inhibitor-based antiviral drug for use with other anti-HIV medicines to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children at ages 6-16 years 23,31,32 (http://www.fuzeon.com). Although T20 is an indispensable anti-HIV drug for HIV/ AIDS patients who have failed to respond to the current antiretroviral therapeutics, its shortcomings have limited its clinical application.',\n",
       "  'T20 has lower anti-HIV activity and shorter half-life than other CHR peptides containing PBD, such as C34 and C38 8, 9, 33 . In addition, T20-resistant HIV-1 variants emerged shortly (e.g., 14 days) after its use in patients 34 . Most of the T20-resistant viruses carried mutations in the GIV motif (residues 36-45: GIVQQQNNLL) in the gp41 NHR domain 10,      . The lack of PBD contributes to the major weaknesses of T20 described above. Since the conserved hydrophobic pocket in the gp41 NHR-trimer plays a critical role in stabilizing the interaction between the gp41 NHR and CHR and formation of the fusogenic 6-HB core 1, 39, 40 , the PBD-containing CHR-peptide, like C34, can bind to viral gp41 trimer more strongly and stably, thus possessing more potent anti-HIV activity than T20, a CHR peptide without PBD 8, 9 . In the absence of PBD, T20 mainly interacts with the middle region of the NHR domain containing the GIV motif.',\n",
       "  \"Therefore, a virus with mutations in this motif is generally resistant to T20 10,      . Compared with other anti-HIV drugs, another weakness of T20 is its cross-reactivity with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients. Besides gp41, T20 could also bind to some regions in gp120. The preexisting antibodies specific for the T20's binding sites in gp120 and gp41 may indirectly suppress the anti-HIV activity of T20 14, 15 .Addition of PBD to the N-terminus of T20, such as T-1249, could significantly improve the anti-HIV-1 potency, half-life and drug-resistance profile 33,    . Addition of M-T hook structure to the N-terminus of a PBD-containing CHR-peptides, such as MT-C34 or MT-SFT, could further increase the anti-HIV-1 activity of the corresponding CHR-peptides 17, 18 . Deletion of the GIV-motif-binding domain from a CHR-peptide, such as CP621-652 and CP32M, is another effective approach to increase the genetic barrier to drug resistance 44, 45 .\",\n",
       "  'However, none of the above approaches is effective in preventing the cross-reaction of T20 with the preexisting anti-gp41 antibodies in HIV/AIDS patients, since the above-modified peptides mainly contain the native sequences of the HIV-1 gp41 CHR domain. Our previous studies have shown that AP1 and AP2, artificial peptides with non-native protein sequences, could form coiled-coil structure to interact with gp41 NHR and inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion 16 . In the present study, we designed a new artificial peptide, AP3, by adding M-T hook structure to the N-terminus of AP2 (Fig. 1a) , followed by investigating the influence of preexisting anti-gp41 antibodies in HIV-infected patients on AP3, using AP1, AP2 and T20 as controls. We demonstrated that sera of HIV-infected patients could bind to T20 and significantly reduce its potency against HIV-1. However, these same serum samples did not interact with the three artificial peptides and hardly impaired their antiviral activity.',\n",
       "  \"Surprisingly, the antibodies in the sera could even enhance AP3's anti-HIV-1 activity (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Table S1 ). These results confirmed, for the first time, that replacement of the native viral sequence in T20 with an artificial sequence is an effective approach to overcome a key shortcoming of T20 whereby its anti-HIV activity could be attenuated by preexisting anti-gp41 antibodies in HIV/AIDS patients. It is worthwhile to explore why the antibodies in the sera is able to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of AP3. Our recent study has demonstrated that T20's anti-HIV-1 activity is enhanced by a non-neutralizing antibody directed against the NHR domain of the HIV-1 gp41 46 . We thus hypothesize that some of the anti-gp41 antibodies in HIV/AIDS patients may bind to a site in NHR domain adjacent to the AP3's binding region, resulting in increased interaction between AP3 and NHR-trimer and enhanced antiviral activity of AP3.We then compared the inhibitory activity of AP3 with M-T hook and T20/AP2 without M-T hook on infection by divergent HIV-1 strains.\",\n",
       "  'AP3 was more effective than either AP2 or T20 in inhibiting infection by the laboratory-adapted strains and the primary isolates of HIV-1, including those resistant to T20 (Fig. 1b, Table 1 ). One may question whether AP3 can also induce drug-resistant viruses in patients if it is used in clinics to treat HIV-infected patients. We believe that AP3 is expected to have much higher genetic barrier to resistance than T20 because AP3 contains PBD, while T20 lacks PBD. Dwyer et al. 33 used T2544, a PBD-containing CHR-peptide, to carry out a passaging experiment, using T20 as a control. They demonstrated that T20 could induce a mutant virus with high resistance (81-fold) to T20 in about 1 month, while T2544 failed to induce a resistant strain in more than 2 months in culture.',\n",
       "  \"After extending the passaging experiment for almost 8 months, they identified one strain with a weak resistance (8.3-fold) to T-2544, and the related mutation sites were not in the gp41 pocket region, suggesting that the PBD-containing CHR-peptides, including AP3, may have difficulty to induce drug-resistance.AP3 also had longer half-life than T20 (Table 2) , possibly because the artificial peptide AP3 is less sensitive to the proteolytic enzymes than T20 with native viral protein sequence. Removal of the proteolytic enzymes' cleavage sites in AP3 peptide is expected to further extend its half-life. These results confirmed that replacement of native protein sequence with artificial sequence and addition of the M-T hook to the PBD-containing peptide is a sound strategy for designing HIV fusion inhibitory peptides with improved antiviral activity and pharmacological properties when compared to T20.Since the three-dimensional structures of AP peptides had not been investigated before the present study, the optimization of these artificial peptide inhibitors could not be performed rationally.\",\n",
       "  'Our structural studies of the artificial peptides AP1/AP2/AP3 in complex with NHR showed that AP peptides, just like the CHR peptide C34, could bind to gp41 NHR to form a canonical 6-HB structure (Fig. 5a) . It is well known that a deep hydrophobic pocket exists in each groove on the surface of the viral gp41 NHR trimer. The hydrophobic residues I635, W631 and W628 in the gp41 CHR bind with the hydrophobic residues in the wall of this pocket, resulting in the formation of stable 6-HB by the strong interaction between CHR and NHR. This important feature has been well preserved in the AP1/AP2/AP3 6-HB structures (Fig. 5b) , which may account for the potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activities of these artificial peptides.A new hydrogen bond, which was established between S57 and Q18 in AP1/AP2/AP3 complexes, does not exist in the viral gp41 CHR-NHR complex, suggesting that S57 may play an important role in stabilizing the interactions between the peptide and NHR, resulting in binding affinities of AP1/AP2/AP3 that are stronger than those of HIV-1 gp41 CHR to NHR.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, the EE-KK double salt bridge formed between the i and i + 4 positions in the AP1/AP2/AP3 structures could stabilize helix conformation and increase the inhibitory effect of these peptides. Compared with AP1, triple-site mutations were introduced in AP2 and AP3, i.e. M44E, R48K and E49K. Those substitutions not only increase solubility of the peptide, but also trigger a series of rearrangements of certain intrahelical salt bridges to improve the stability of CHR helix structure and HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity.M-T hook was previously demonstrated to be an effective step toward increasing the stable interaction between a CHR-peptide and the HIV-1 gp41 pocket 17, 18 . Therefore, AP2 was further optimized by incorporating Met and Thr at its N-terminus. CD spectroscopy and thermal denaturation results both indicate that the incorporation of M-T hook contribute to the formation of a more stable 6-HB core structure between AP3 (M-T hook-optimized AP2) and N36.',\n",
       "  'In addition, the EE-KK double salt bridge formed between i and i + 4 positions in the N36-L6-AP3 structure contributed to increased CHR helix and 6-HB stability, resulting in improved potency of AP3, as has been noted in studies of CHR-peptides with EE-KK double mutations 30, 33, 47, 48 . Also, the HIV-1 fusion activity and half-life of AP2 may have been strengthened and extended, respectively, by the addition of M-T hook in the design of AP3.In conclusion, AP3, an artificial peptide with both PBD and M-T hook structures, exhibited improved anti-HIV-1 activity and drug-resistance profile, as well as prolonged half-life. Moreover, it did not react with the preexisting antibodies in the sera of HIV/AIDS patients. Consequently, its antiviral activity Scientific RepoRts | 5:13028 | DOi: 10.1038/srep13028 was not significantly affected by these antibodies. Therefore, AP3 shows promise as a candidate for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor for clinical use.',\n",

The CD spectra of each sample were acquired on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (Model J-815, Jasco Inc., Japan) at 4 °C using a 5 nm bandwidth, 0.1 nm resolution, 0.1 cm path length, and an average time of 5.0 sec. Spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent composition of each sample. Thermal midpoint analysis was used to determine the temperature at which 50% of the 6-HB formed by the CHR and NHR would decompose.',\n",

Analysis of the half-life of peptide inhibitors. Four male SD rats weighing approximately 200 g each were obtained from the Shanghai Medical School Animal Center and were used for the half-life assay. Animals were treated in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (NIH Publication 86-23, revised 1985). Either AP2 or AP3 was intravenously injected at the concentration of 1 mg/ml.

The virus has a high humanto-human transmissibility via airborne, droplet and contact routes  . Patient numbers can surge, and hospitals should be ready not just with the infrastructure, but also staff to be familiar with workflows. Kain and Fowler  have eloquently detailed influenza pandemic preparations for hospitals and intensive care units, and we feel the principles described in the article are relevant to COVID-19. Staff must consider patient transfers in between wards, as COVID-19 patients are admitted in isolation facilities to contain infected cases and to avoid nosocomial spread  .Infectious cases may be intentionally brought out of isolation rooms for various reasons.',\n",
       "  'Intra-hospital transfer may be required from emergency departments to the wards, from the general floor to the intensive care unit and from the wards to radiology suites. Inter-hospital transfer may be required for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if patients with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome within hospitals with only basic ventilation facilities. During episodes of patient transport outside of isolation, potential breaches of infection control can occur. At the same time, when COVID-19 patients turn ill during transport, their management is exceptionally challenging as accompanying staff would be wearing cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE)  .Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is a national priority in Singapore  , and part of this effort involves planning and conducting safe patient transport for suspected or confirmed cases. HCWs who handle the transport of COVID-19 patients must consider the following principles (see Table 1 ): firstly, early recognition of the deteriorating patient; secondly, HCW safety; thirdly, bystander safety; fourthly, contingency plans for medical emergencies during transport; fifthly, post-transport decontamination.',\n",
       "  'Specific action steps require designated zones for transport  , sufficient supplies of PPE, staff training and support personnel like security officers and cleaning crews. Powered air-purifying respirators add a layer of safety on top of N95 respirators  and should be used if possible for high-risk cases, such as those requiring ambulance transport to ECMO centres.Given the continued global spread of COVID-19, we expect that more hospitals will need to deal with this disease. Haphazard transport of infected cases leading to nosocomial spread can stymie efforts to break the chains of transmission. We hope that our suggestions can aid others in ensuring safe patient transport for COVID-19 and reduce nosocomial spread.

       " ['The list of recently discovered gastrointestinal viruses is expanding rapidly. Whether these agents are actually involved in a disease such as diarrhea is the essential question, yet difficult to answer. In this review a summary of all viruses found in diarrhea is presented, together with the current knowledge about their connection to disease.Text: The gastrointestinal tract is a vulnerable organ for infections as there is constant contact with the outside, mainly via the oral route. Inflammation of the stomach and the intestines (gastroenteritis) can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Gastroenteritis is responsible for two to three million deaths each year, making it one of the most common causes of mortality  . Mainly children in developing countries, but also immuno-compromised individuals in developed countries, suffer from diarrhea. While bacterial and parasitic gastrointestinal infections are declining as a result of proper disposal of sewage and safe drinking water, viral gastroenteritis is not declining in developing countries  .',\n",
       "  'In the developed world, viruses are already the most common pathogens causing diarrhea  .Although viruses infecting humans had already been described since 1901  and viruses were suspected to play a role in diarrhea, it lasted until 1972, when the first virus causing gastroenteritis (norovirus) was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in Norwalk (California, United States)  . Shortly after the discovery of norovirus several other viruses causing gastroenteritis were discovered: rotavirus in epithelial cells of children with gastroenteritis  , astrovirus in infantile diarrhea cases  , enteric adenoviruses in the feces of children with acute diarrhea  , and sapovirus during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in an orphanage in Sapporo, Japan  . All these viruses spread via the fecal-oral route through person-to-person transmission and are described in more detail below.Noroviruses are part of the family Caliciviridae and outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis have been reported in cruise ships, health care settings, schools, and in the military, but norovirus is also responsible for around 60% of all sporadic diarrhea cases (diarrhea cases where an enteropathogen could be found), reviewed in the literature [10, 11] .',\n",
       "  'The pathogenesis of norovirus infection has been tested in vivo. Filtrated norovirus was given to healthy volunteers after which most of them developed diarrhea  . Culturing of the virus, however, has been a problem since its discovery, yet one study has recently described the cultivation of norovirus in B cells, and has revealed that co-factors, such as histo-blood antigen expressing enteric bacteria, are probably needed before enteric viruses can be cultured in vitro  . Sapoviruses are also members of the Caliciviridae. There are five human genogroups of sapovirus described  which account for 2.2%-12.7% of all gastroenteritis cases around the globe [14, 15] . Sapovirus outbreaks occur throughout the year and can be foodborne  .',\n",
       "  'For sapoviruses it has been described that the virus was not found before onset of an outbreak, and that it was found in 95% of the patients during an outbreak, while it declined to 50% after an outbreak, indicating that the virus introduces disease in a naturally infected host  .Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis among children; however, parents of infected children also often become ill and as a result rotavirus is the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults  . Studies in human volunteers have shown that infection with rotavirus causes diarrhea, results in shedding of the virus and a rise in antibody anti-virus titer after infection  . Additionally, astroviruses infections are common, accounting for about 10% of all sporadic diarrhea cases  . Astrovirus has been isolated from diseased people, filtrated and administered to healthy individuals after which in some of the volunteers diarrheal disease was observed and astrovirus was shed in their stools  .',\n",
       "  'The virus can replicate in human embryonic kidney cells and was detected by electron microscopy (EM)  . Adenoviruses are responsible for around 1.5%-5.4% of the diarrhea cases in children under the age of 2 years, reviewed in the literature  . Of the 57 identified adenovirus types  , only adenoviruses type 40 and 41 are associated with diarrhea  . Next to these two types, adenovirus type 52 can also cause gastroenteritis  , although it has been argued whether type 52 is actually a separate type since there is not sufficient distance to adenovirus type 41  . Adenoviruses can generally be propagated in cell lines; however, enteric adenovirus 40/41 are difficult to culture, reviewed in the literature  .In the 1980s and 1990s some viral agents were identified for which the direct association with disease is less clear. Aichi viruses are members of the Picornaviridae identified in fecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis  .',\n",
       "  'Aichi virus infection has been shown to elicit an immune response  . Since their discovery, two case-control studies were performed, but, although both studies only found Aichi virus in stools of diarrheic patients, the prevalence of Aichi virus (0.5% and 1.8%) was too low to find a significant association with diarrhea [30, 31] . In immuno-compromised hosts the virus is found in higher quantities and is not associated with diarrhea  . Toroviruses, part of the Coronaviridae, were first identified in 1984 in stools of children and adults with gastroenteritis  . Torovirus infection is associated with diarrhea  and is more frequently observed in immuno-compromised patients and in nosocomial infected individuals  . Retrospective analysis of nosocomial viral gastroenteritis in a pediatric hospital revealed that in 67% of the cases torovirus could be detected  . However, only a limited number of studies report the detection of torovirus and therefore the true pathogenesis and prevalence of this virus remains elusive.',\n",
       "  \"Picobirnaviruses belong to the Picobirnaviridae and were first detected in the feces of children with gastroenteritis  . Since the initial discovery, the virus has been detected in fecal samples of several animal species, and it has been shown that the viruses are genetically highly diverse without a clear species clustering, reviewed in the literature  . This high sequence diversity has also been observed within particular outbreaks of gastroenteritis [38, 39] , limiting the likelihood that picobirnaviruses are actually causing outbreaks, as no distinct single source of infection can be identified.In 1907 the first tissue culture system was developed which was regarded as the golden standard for virus detection for a long time, reviewed in the literature  . In the 1930's serology and electron microscopy were introduced which boosted the discovery of new viruses. During these years, these methods developed fruitfully but viruses infecting the gastrointestinal tract were especially difficult to culture.\",\n",
       "  'Throughout the last several decades, several DNA-based techniques have been developed for virus discovery that boosted the identification of novel viruses in stool samples. The four most used methods are: 1. Universal primer-PCR  ; 2. Random priming-based PCR  ; 3. Virus Discovery cDNA, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA)  ; and 4. Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA)  . Universal primer-PCR is a virus discovery technique that uses universal primers designed on conserved parts of a specific viral family, which can be used to detect novel variants of this viral family. Random priming-based PCR is a technique that randomly amplifies all nucleic acids present in samples, after which the resulting PCR products can be cloned and sequenced. SISPA and VIDISCA are virus discovery techniques that are based on digestion with restriction enzymes, after which adaptors can be ligated. These methods have been successful in the discovery of novel viruses, but there are some limitations.',\n",
       "  'Universal primers are useful for discovering novel viruses of a chosen family, but the primers, based on our present knowledge of the viral family, may not fit on all unknown variants. Random priming PCR, SISPA and VIDISCA are sequence independent amplification techniques. The disadvantage of random priming PCR, SISPA and VIDISCA is that the virus needs to be present at a high concentration, while the host background DNA and/or RNA should be minimal and preferably not complex.In recent years, sequence independent amplification techniques improved considerably by coupling these techniques to next-generation sequencing platforms and as a result several novel viruses have been described in gastroenteritis cases, such as cosavirus  , Saffold virus  , klassevirus/salivirus [47, 48] , polyomavirus  , bufavirus  , tusavirus  , and recovirus  . Although these viruses are found in individuals with diarrhea, for most of them the degree of circulation (prevalence) and the ability to cause morbid conditions or disease (pathogenesis) remains to be determined, as described below (also see Table 1 ).',\n",
       "  'Only found in low prevalence; **: Only limited data is available about this virus; ***: Antibodies against astrovirus HMO-C were observed whereas no antibodies against astrovirus HMO-A were found (HMO = human-mink-ovine-like astrovirus); -No published data available;ˆPicobirnavirus, tusavirus and recovirus were identified in the gastrointestinal tract after next-generation sequencing, but no information regarding antibody response or association with diarrhea is available.In the last decade, two novel clades of astroviruses have been discovered in stool samples from patients with diarrhea that are genetically far distinct from the classical astroviruses. The first clade consists of the VA-1, VA-2, VA-3, VA-4, and VA-5 astroviruses, which are genetically related to feline and porcine astroviruses, while the second clade consists of the MLB1, MLB2 and MLB3 astroviruses and form a separate cluster [55, 57,      .',\n",
       "  'For these novel clades the pathogenesis remains to be determined since the viruses have been identified in patients with and without diarrhea, and in some studies the viruses were associated with diarrhea whilst in others no association could be found    . In addition an antibody response was observed against some but not all novel astrovirus types [54, 58] . Recently, astrovirus MLB2 has also been detected in blood plasma of a febrile child  and astrovirus VA1 in a frontal cortex biopsy specimen from a patient with encephalitis  , suggesting that astrovirus infection may not be limited to the gastrointestinal tract.In 2008, Saffold virus was detected in a stool sample from a pediatric patient with fever of unknown origin  . Although Saffold virus type 3 was cultured on a human epithelial cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell line, cytopathic effects were observed and neutralizing antibodies have been found in serum samples  , subsequent case-control studies showed that the virus was not significantly associated with diarrhea [53, 60, 61] .',\n",
       "  'Additionally, in 2008 cosavirus was identified in a patient with diarrhea  . However, a case-control study showed that this virus was also detected in a substantial amount of individuals without diarrhea and is not associated with diarrhea [32, 62, 63] . Klassevirus/salivirus was identified in 2009 in two fecal samples from infants with gastrointestinal disorders [47, 48] . In two studies the detection of this virus was associated with diarrhea [48, 53] , while in another study no association with disease was found  . Serological evidence of human klassevirus infection was obtained, suggesting that the virus infects human cells  .With the use of next-generation sequencing techniques, three novel polyomaviruses were also identified in human fecal samples. MW polyomavirus was identified in the stool of a healthy child from Malawi in 2012  , and in the same year MX polyomavirus was found in stool samples of patients with and without diarrhea from Mexico, United States and Chili  .',\n",
       "  'One year later, STL polyomavirus was found in the stool of a healthy child from Malawi  . An antibody response against MX polyomavirus  and MW polyomavirus  was observed, although MW polyomavirus  and STL polyomavirus  were not significantly associated with diarrhea in two independent case-control studies.Bufavirus is a member of the Parvoviridae and was first described in 2012  . Two case-controls in Thailand and in Turkey showed that the virus was only found in patients with diarrhea and not in controls [72, 73] ; however, because of the low prevalence (respectively 0.3% in Thailand and 1.4% in Turkey), no significant association with disease was found. Tusavirus, another recently described member of the Parvoviridae, was identified in the feces of a child from Tunisia with unexplained diarrhea  , and thus far this is the only study describing this virus. Recovirus is a novel member of the Caliciviridae and was found in diarrhea samples from Bangladesh  .',\n",
       "  'Similar to tusavirus, this is the only study describing this virus thus far.The identification of the above-mentioned novel viruses certainly increased our knowledge about viruses that can be found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, yet it is unknown how many of these novel viruses are actually enteropathogens. Human stool contains a wide variety of viruses which can be derived from different hosts: Besides genuine human viruses, plant dietary viruses [32, 81] and animal dietary viruses  can also be found in human stool, as well as bacteriophages and viruses infecting protozoa  . Even viruses derived from other parts of the body can be found in fecal samples, such as the John Cunningham Polyoma virus originating from the kidney ending up in feces via urine  , and rhinoviruses  , bocaviruses  and coronaviruses  originating from the respiratory tract and probably swallowed. Furthermore, viruses infecting blood cells such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 can also be detected in fecal samples  .',\n",
       "  'Therefore, once a novel virus has been identified in human stool samples it is does not indicate that this virus is replicating in human intestinal cells.Koch recognized as early as 1891 that associating the presence of a certain agent with a certain disease is complex, and he therefore postulated guidelines that should be followed before an agent can be classified as a pathogen  . His postulates can be summarized in three points: (1) The microbe occurs in every case of the disease in question and under circumstances which can account for the pathological changes and clinical course of the disease; (2) the microbe occurs in no other disease as a fortuitous and nonpathogenic parasite; and (3), after being fully isolated from the body and repeatedly grown in pure culture, the microbe can induce the disease anew.',\n",
       "  'If a microbe has fulfilled these three postulates it can be stated that \"the occurrence of the microbe in the disease can no longer be accidental, but in this case no other relation between it and the disease except that the microbe is the cause of the disease can be considered\". For enteric viruses, however, these postulates are not applicable. Firstly, the enteric viruses are not easily cultured    , and, secondly, prolonged sheading of viral agents and asymptomatic infection have been described  , reviewed in the literature  . Although attempts have been made to adjust the Koch\\'s postulates specifically for viruses and the current methodologies deployed    , fulfilling these postulates is still not feasible on most occasions due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system, difficulties in antigen synthesis and high levels of viral genetic diversity within viral groups, reviewed in the literature  .Several approaches have been made to develop a methodology that adds more significance to the discovery of a novel virus.',\n",
       "  'One approach is based on the enrichment of immunogenic viruses before next-generation sequencing by making use of autologous antibody capture prior to sequencing. This method was tested and validated on several fecal samples containing adenovirus, sapovirus and norovirus, and has shown to enrich immunogenic viruses, while plant viruses and bacteriophages were not enriched after antibody capture  . Another method to enrich for relevant viruses prior to next-generation sequencing is the so-called virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) which uses~2 million probes which cover the genomes of all members of the viral taxa known to infect vertebrates  . However, both methods have limitations: For the antibody capture method, viruses need to be present in high viral loads, and convalescent blood, serum or plasma needs to be available. A disadvantage of the VirCapSeq-VERT technique is that completely novel viruses, e.g., viruses from a novel virus family, will not be identified.The most straightforward method to demonstrate association with disease is using case-control studies.',\n",
       "  'In order to perform such studies, matched stool samples have to be collected in case and control groups from the same geographical locations in the same period of the year. Additionally, whereas in recent years case-control studies have been performed using conventional real-time PCRs (RT-PCR), in the future, sequence independent next-generation sequencing techniques can be used for such case-control studies. Since it allows detection of virtually all nucleic acids, next-generation sequencing has several advantages compared to specific RT-PCRs. Next-generation sequencing prevents the necessity to perform numerous RT-PCRs to screen for all viruses suspected to be associated with disease, and novel variants of currently known viral families or novel virus species can be detected which can be particularly beneficial if only few reference genomes are available.',\n",
       "  'The major benefit of such a database is that in the immediate future the most important question can be answered if a novel virus is identified in diarrhea cases: Is the virus likely to cause disease?In conclusion, the long list of viruses identified in the gastrointestinal tract is most probably not final yet. It is to be expected that several novel viruses will be described in the near future, since detection of these agents using the current next-generation sequence technologies is no longer a difficulty. Therefore, adding relevance to the discovery of novel viruses should be the main goal for future studies.'],\n",
       " ['For the past 25 years, phage display technology has been an invaluable tool for studies of protein–protein interactions. However, the inherent biological, biochemical, and biophysical properties of filamentous bacteriophage, as well as the ease of its genetic manipulation, also make it an attractive platform outside the traditional phage display canon. This review will focus on the unique properties of the filamentous bacteriophage and highlight its diverse applications in current research. Particular emphases are placed on: (i) the advantages of the phage as a vaccine carrier, including its high immunogenicity, relative antigenic simplicity and ability to activate a range of immune responses, (ii) the phage’s potential as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for infectious and chronic diseases, (iii) the regularity of the virion major coat protein lattice, which enables a variety of bioconjugation and surface chemistry applications, particularly in nanomaterials, and (iv) the phage’s large population sizes and fast generation times, which make it an excellent model system for directed protein evolution.',\n",
       "  \"Despite their ubiquity in the biosphere, metagenomics work is just beginning to explore the ecology of filamentous and non-filamentous phage, and their role in the evolution of bacterial populations. Thus, the filamentous phage represents a robust, inexpensive, and versatile microorganism whose bioengineering applications continue to expand in new directions, although its limitations in some spheres impose obstacles to its widespread adoption and use.Text: The filamentous bacteriophage (genera Inovirus and Plectrovirus) are non-enveloped, rod-shaped viruses of Escherichia coli whose long helical capsids encapsulate a single-stranded circular DNA genome. Subsequent to the independent discovery of bacteriophage by Twort (1915) and d 'Hérelle (1917) , the first filamentous phage, f1, was isolated in Loeb (1960) and later characterized as a member of a larger group of phage (Ff, including f1, M13, and fd phage) specific for the E. coli conjugative F pilus (Hofschneider and Mueller-Jensen, 1963; Marvin and Hoffmann-Berling, 1963; Zinder et al., 1963; Salivar et al., 1964) .\",\n",
       "  'Soon thereafter, filamentous phage were discovered that do not use F-pili for entry (If and Ike; Meynell and Lawn, 1968; Khatoon et al., 1972) , and over time the list of known filamentous phage has expanded to over 60 members (Fauquet et al., 2005) , including temperate and Gram-positivetropic species. Work by multiple groups over the past 50 years has contributed to a relatively sophisticated understanding of filamentous phage structure, biology and life cycle (reviewed in Marvin, 1998; Rakonjac et al., 2011; Rakonjac, 2012) .In the mid-1980s, the principle of modifying the filamentous phage genome to display polypeptides as fusions to coat proteins on the virion surface was invented by Smith and colleagues (Smith, 1985; Parmley and Smith, 1988) . Based on the ideas described in Parmley and Smith (1988) , groups in California, Germany, and the UK developed phage-display platforms to create and screen libraries of peptide and folded-protein variants (Bass et al., 1990; Devlin et al., 1990; McCafferty et al., 1990; Scott and Smith, 1990; Breitling et al., 1991; Kang et al., 1991) .',\n",
       "  'This technology allowed, for the first time, the ability to seamlessly connect genetic information with protein function for a large number of protein variants simultaneously, and has been widely and productively exploited in studies of proteinprotein interactions. Many excellent reviews are available on phage-display libraries and their applications (Kehoe and Kay, 2005; Bratkovic, 2010; Pande et al., 2010) . However, the phage also has a number of unique structural and biological properties that make it highly useful in areas of research that have received far less attention.Thus, the purpose of this review is to highlight recent and current work using filamentous phage in novel and nontraditional applications. Specifically, we refer to projects that rely on the filamentous phage as a key element, but whose primary purpose is not the generation or screening of phagedisplayed libraries to obtain binding polypeptide ligands.',\n",
       "  \"These tend to fall into four major categories of use: (i) filamentous phage as a vaccine carrier; (ii) engineered filamentous phage as a therapeutic biologic agent in infectious and chronic diseases; (iii) filamentous phage as a scaffold for bioconjugation and surface chemistry; and (iv) filamentous phage as an engine for evolving variants of displayed proteins with novel functions. A final section is dedicated to recent developments in filamentous phage ecology and phage-host interactions. Common themes shared amongst all these applications include the unique biological, immunological, and physicochemical properties of the phage, its ability to display a variety of biomolecules in modular fashion, and its relative simplicity and ease of manipulation.Nearly all applications of the filamentous phage depend on its ability to display polypeptides on the virion's surface as fusions to phage coat proteins ( Table 1) .\",\n",
       "  'The display mode determines the maximum tolerated size of the fused polypeptide, its copy number on the phage, and potentially, the structure of the displayed polypeptide. Display may be achieved by fusing DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest directly to the gene encoding a coat protein within the phage genome (type 8 display on pVIII, type 3 display on pIII, etc. ), resulting in fully recombinant phage.

       "  '2 The copy number depends on polypeptide size; typically <1 copy per phage particle but for pVIII peptide display can be up to ∼15% of pVIII molecules in hybrid virions. 3 The total number of pVIII molecules depends on the phage genome size; one pVIII molecule is added for every 2.3 nucleotides in the viral genome. recombinant gene 8 is on a plasmid with a phage origin of replication) resulting in a hybrid virion bearing two different types of a given coat protein. Multivalent display on some coat proteins can also be enforced using helper phage bearing nonfunctional copies of the relevant coat protein gene (e.g., type 3 * +3 display). By far the most commonly used coat proteins for display are the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, with the major advantage of the former being higher copy number display (up to ∼15% of recombinant pVIII molecules in a hybrid virion, at least for short peptide fusions), and of the latter being the ability to display some folded proteins at an appreciable copy number (1-5 per phage particle).',\n",
       "  'While pVIII display of folded proteins on hybrid phage is possible, it typically results in a copy number of much less than 1 per virion (Sidhu et al., 2000) . For the purposes of this review, we use the term \"phage display\" to refer to a recombinant filamentous phage displaying a single polypeptide sequence on its surface (or more rarely, bispecific display achieved via fusion of polypeptides to two different capsid proteins), and the term \"phage-displayed library\" to refer to a diverse pool of recombinant filamentous phage displaying an array of polypeptide variants (e.g., antibody fragments; peptides). Such libraries are typically screened by iterative cycles of panning against an immobilized protein of interest (e.g., antigen for phage-displayed antibody libraries; antibody for phage-displayed peptide libraries) followed by amplification of the bound phage in E. coli cells.Early work with anti-phage antisera generated for species classification purposes demonstrated that the filamentous phage virion is highly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvants (Meynell and Lawn, 1968 ) and that only the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, are targeted by antibodies (Pratt et al., 1969; Woolford et al., 1977) .',\n",
       "  \"Thus, the idea of using the phage as carrier to elicit antibodies against poorly immunogenic haptens or polypeptide was a natural extension of the ability to display recombinant exogenous sequences on its surface, which was first demonstrated by de la Cruz et al. (1988) . The phage particle's low cost of production, high stability and potential for high valency display of foreign antigen (via pVIII display) also made it attractive as a vaccine carrier, especially during the early stages of development of recombinant protein technology.Building upon existing peptide-carrier technology, the first filamentous phage-based vaccine immunogens displayed short amino acid sequences derived directly from proteins of interest as recombinant fusions to pVIII or pIII (de la Cruz et al., 1988) .\",\n",
       "  \"As library technology was developed and refined, phage-based antigens displaying peptide ligands of monoclonal antibodies (selected from random peptide libraries using the antibody, thus simulating with varying degrees of success the antibody's folded epitope on its cognate antigen; Geysen et al., 1986; Knittelfelder et al., 2009) were also generated for immunization purposes, with the goal of eliciting anti-peptide antibodies that also recognize the native protein. Some of the pioneering work in this area used peptides derived from infectious disease antigens (or peptide ligands of antibodies against these antigens; Table 2) , including malaria and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). When displayed on phage, peptides encoding the repeat regions of the malarial circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein 1 were immunogenic in mice and rabbits (de la Cruz et al., 1988; Greenwood et al., 1991; Willis et al., 1993; Demangel et al., 1996) , and antibodies raised against the latter cross-reacted with the full-length protein.\",\n",
       "  'Various peptide determinants (or mimics thereof) of HIV-1 gp120, gp41, gag, and reverse transcriptase were immunogenic when displayed on or conjugated to phage coat proteins (Minenkova et al., 1993; di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994; De Berardinis et al., 1999; Scala et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001; van Houten et al., 2006 van Houten et al., , 2010 , and in some cases elicited antibodies that were able to weakly neutralize lab-adapted viruses (di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994; Scala et al., 1999) . The list of animal and human infections for which phage-displayed peptide immunogens have been developed as vaccine leads continues to expand and includes bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens ( Table 2) .',\n",
       "  'While in some cases the results of these studies have been promising, antibody epitope-based peptide vaccines are no longer an area of active research for several reasons: (i) in many cases, peptides incompletely or inadequately mimic epitopes on folded proteins (Irving et al., 2010 ; see below); (ii) antibodies against a single epitope may be of limited utility, especially for highly variable pathogens (Van Regenmortel, 2012); and (iii) for pathogens for which protective immune responses are generated efficiently during natural infection, peptide vaccines offer few advantages over recombinant subunit and live vector vaccines, which have become easier to produce over time.More recently, peptide-displaying phage have been used in attempts to generate therapeutic antibody responses for chronic diseases, cancer, immunotherapy, and immunocontraception.',\n",
       "  \"Immunization with phage displaying Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid fibril peptides elicited anti-aggregating antibodies in mice and guinea pigs (Frenkel et al., 2000 (Frenkel et al., , 2003 Esposito et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011) , possibly reduced amyloid plaque formation in mice (Frenkel et al., 2003; Solomon, 2005; Esposito et al., 2008) , and may have helped maintain cognitive abilities in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (Lavie et al., 2004) ; however, it remains unclear how such antibodies are proposed to cross the blood-brain barrier. Yip et al. (2001) found that antibodies raised in mice against an ERBB2/HER2 peptide could inhibit breast-cancer cell proliferation. Phage displaying peptide ligands of an anti-IgE antibody elicited antibodies that bound purified IgE molecules (Rudolf et al., 1998) , which may be useful in allergy immunotherapy. Several strategies for phage-based contraceptive vaccines have been proposed for control of animal populations.\",\n",
       "  'For example, immunization with phage displaying follicle-stimulating hormone peptides on pVIII elicited antibodies that impaired the fertility of mice and ewes (Abdennebi et al., 1999) . Phage displaying or chemically Rubinchik and Chow (2000) conjugated to sperm antigen peptides or peptide mimics (Samoylova et al., 2012a,b) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Samoylov et al., 2012) are also in development.For the most part, peptides displayed on phage elicit antibodies in experimental animals ( Table 2) , although this depends on characteristics of the peptide and the method of its display: pIII fusions tend toward lower immunogenicity than pVIII fusions (Greenwood et al., 1991) possibly due to copy number differences (pIII: 1-5 copies vs. pVIII: estimated at several hundred copies; Malik et al., 1996) . In fact, the phage is at least as immunogenic as traditional carrier proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; Melzer et al., 2003; Su et al., 2007) , and has comparatively few endogenous B-cell epitopes to divert the antibody response from its intended target (Henry et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'Excepting small epitopes that can be accurately represented by a contiguous short amino acid sequence, however, it has been extremely difficult to elicit antibody responses that cross-react with native protein epitopes using peptides. The overall picture is considerably bleaker than that painted by Table 2 , since in several studies either: (i) peptide ligands selected from phage-displayed libraries were classified by the authors as mimics of discontinuous epitopes if they bore no obvious sequence homology to the native protein, which is weak evidence of non-linearity, or (ii) the evidence for cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by immunization with phage-displayed peptides with native protein was uncompelling. Irving et al. (2010) describe at least one reason for this lack of success: it seems that peptide antigens elicit a set of topologically restricted antibodies that are largely unable to recognize discontinuous or complex epitopes on larger biomolecules.',\n",
       "  \"While the peptide may mimic the chemistry of a given epitope on a folded protein (allowing it to crossreact with a targeted antibody), being a smaller molecule, it cannot mimic the topology of that antibody's full epitope.Despite this, the filamentous phage remains highly useful as a carrier for peptides with relatively simple secondary structures, which may be stablilized via anchoring to the coat proteins (Henry et al., 2011) . This may be especially true of peptides with poor inherent immunogenicity, which may be increased by high-valency display and phage-associated adjuvanticity (see Immunological Mechanisms of Vaccination with Filamentous Phage below).The filamentous phage has been used to a lesser extent as a carrier for T-cell peptide epitopes, primarily as fusion proteins with pVIII ( Table 3) . Early work, showing that immunization with phage elicited T-cell help (Kölsch et al., 1971; Willis et al., 1993) , was confirmed by several subsequent studies (De Berardinis et al., 1999; Ulivieri et al., 2008) .\",\n",
       "  'From the perspective of vaccination against infectious disease, De Berardinis et al. (2000) showed that a cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) epitope from HIV-1 reverse transcriptase could elicit antigen-specific CTLs in vitro and in vivo without addition of exogenous helper T-cell epitopes, presumably since these are already present in the phage coat proteins (Mascolo et al., 2007) . Similarly, efficient priming of CTLs was observed against phage-displayed T-cell epitopes from Hepatitis B virus (Wan et al., 2001) and Candida albicans (Yang et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2006 Wang et al., , 2014d , which, together with other types of immune responses, protected mice against systemic candidiasis. Vaccination with a combination of phagedisplayed peptides elicited antigen-specific CTLs that proved effective in reducing porcine cysticercosis in a randomized controlled trial (Manoutcharian et al., 2004; Morales et al., 2008) .While the correlates of vaccine-induced immune protection for infectious diseases, where they are known, are almost exclusively serum or mucosal antibodies (Plotkin, 2010) , In certain vaccine applications, the filamentous phage has been used as a carrier for larger molecules that would be immunogenic even in isolation.',\n",
       "  'Initially, the major advantages to phage display of such antigens were speed, ease of purification and low cost of production (Gram et al., 1993) . E. coli F17a-G adhesin (Van Gerven et al., 2008) , hepatitis B core antigen (Bahadir et al., 2011) , and hepatitis B surface antigen (Balcioglu et al., 2014) all elicited antibody responses when displayed on pIII, although none of these studies compared the immunogenicity of the phage-displayed proteins with that of the purified protein alone. Phage displaying Schistosoma mansoni glutathione S-transferase on pIII elicited an antibody response that was both higher in titer and of different isotypes compared to immunization with the protein alone (Rao et al., 2003) . Two studies of antiidiotypic vaccines have used the phage as a carrier for antibody fragments bearing immunogenic idiotypes. Immunization with phage displaying the 1E10 idiotype scFv (mimicking a Vibrio anguillarum surface epitope) elicited antibodies that protected flounder fish from Vibrio anguillarum challenge (Xia et al., 2005) .',\n",
       "  'A chemically linked phage-BCL1 tumor-specific idiotype vaccine was weakly immunogenic in mice but extended survival time in a B-cell lymphoma model (Roehnisch et al., 2013) , and was welltolerated and immunogenic in patients with multiple myeloma (Roehnisch et al., 2014) . One study of DNA vaccination with an anti-laminarin scFv found that DNA encoding a pIII-scFv fusion protein elicited stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses than DNA encoding the scFv alone (Cuesta et al., 2006) , suggesting that under some circumstances, endogenous phage T-cell epitopes can enhance the immunogenicity of associated proteins. Taken together, the results of these studies show that as a particulate virus-like particle, the filamentous phage likely triggers different types of immune responses than recombinant protein antigens, and provide additional T-cell help to displayed or conjugated proteins.',\n",
       "  'However, the low copy number of pIII-displayed proteins, as well as potentially unwanted phage-associated adjuvanticity, can make display of recombinant proteins by phage a suboptimal vaccine choice.Although our understanding of the immune response against the filamentous phage pales in comparison to classical model antigens such as ovalbumin, recent work has begun to shed light on the immune mechanisms activated in response to phage vaccination (Figure 1) . The phage particle is immunogenic without adjuvant in all species tested to date, including mice (Willis et al., 1993) , rats (Dente et al., 1994) , rabbits (de la Cruz et al., 1988) , guinea pigs (Frenkel et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2004) , fish (Coull et al., 1996; Xia et al., 2005) , non-human primates (Chen et al., 2001) , and humans (Roehnisch et al., 2014) .',\n",
       "  'Various routes of immunization have been employed, including oral administration (Delmastro et al., 1997) as well as subcutaneous (Grabowska et al., 2000) , intraperitoneal (van Houten et al., 2006) , intramuscular (Samoylova et al., 2012a) , intravenous (Vaks and Benhar, 2011) , and intradermal injection (Roehnisch et al., 2013) ; no published study has directly compared the effect of administration route on filamentous phage immunogenicity. Antibodies are generated against only three major sites on the virion: (i) the surface-exposed N-terminal ∼12 residues of the pVIII monomer lattice (Terry et al., 1997; Kneissel et al., 1999) ; (ii) the N-terminal N1 and N2 domains of pIII (van Houten et al., 2010) ; and (iii) bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) embedded in the phage coat (Henry et al., 2011) . In mice, serum antibody titers against the phage typically reach 1:10 5 -1:10 6 after 2-3 immunizations, and are maintained for at least 1 year postimmunization (Frenkel et al., 2000) .',\n",
       "  'Primary antibody responses against the phage appear to be composed of a mixture of IgM and IgG2b isotypes in C57BL/6 mice, while secondary antibody responses are composed primarily of IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes, with a lesser contribution of IgG2c and IgG3 isotypes (Hashiguchi et al., 2010) . Deletion of the surface-exposed N1 and N2 domains of pIII produces a truncated form of this protein that does not elicit antibodies, but also results in a non-infective phage particle with lower overall immunogenicity (van Houten et al., 2010) .FIGURE 1 | Types of immune responses elicited in response to immunization with filamentous bacteriophage. As a virus-like particle, the filamentous phage engages multiple arms of the immune system, beginning with cellular effectors of innate immunity (macrophages, neutrophils, and possibly natural killer cells), which are recruited to tumor sites by phage displaying tumor-targeting moieties. The phage likelyactivates T-cell independent antibody responses, either via phage-associated TLR ligands or cross-linking by the pVIII lattice.',\n",
       "  'After processing by antigen-presenting cells, phage-derived peptides are presented on MHC class II and cross-presented on MHC class I, resulting in activation of short-lived CTLs and an array of helper T-cell types, which help prime memory CTL and high-affinity B-cell responses.Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.orgAlthough serum anti-phage antibody titers appear to be at least partially T-cell dependent (Kölsch et al., 1971; Willis et al., 1993; De Berardinis et al., 1999; van Houten et al., 2010) , many circulating pVIII-specific B cells in the blood are devoid of somatic mutation even after repeated biweekly immunizations, suggesting that under these conditions, the phage activates T-cell-independent B-cell responses in addition to highaffinity T-cell-dependent responses (Murira, 2014) . Filamentous phage particles can be processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented on MHC class II molecules (Gaubin et al., 2003; Ulivieri et al., 2008) and can activate T H 1, T H 2, and T H 17 helper T cells (Yang et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2014d) .',\n",
       "  \"Anti-phage T H 2 responses were enhanced through display of CTLA-4 peptides fused to pIII (Kajihara et al., 2000) . Phage proteins can also be cross-presented on MHC class I molecules (Wan et al., 2005) and can prime two waves of CTL responses, consisting first of short-lived CTLs and later of long-lived memory CTLs that require CD4 + T-cell help (Del Pozzo et al., 2010) . The latter CTLs mediate a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (Fang et al., 2005; Del Pozzo et al., 2010) .The phage particle is self-adjuvanting through multiple mechanisms. Host cell wall-derived LPS enhances the virion's immunogenicity, and its removal by polymyxin B chromatography reduces antibody titers against phage coat proteins (Grabowska et al., 2000) . The phage's singlestranded DNA genome contains CpG motifs and may also have an adjuvant effect.\",\n",
       "  'The antibody response against the phage is entirely dependent on MyD88 signaling and is modulated by stimulation of several Toll-like receptors (Hashiguchi et al., 2010) , indicating that innate immunity plays an important but largely uncharacterized role in the activation of anti-phage adaptive immune responses. Biodistribution studies of the phage after intravenous injection show that it is cleared from the blood within hours through the reticuloendothelial system (Molenaar et al., 2002) , particularly of the liver and spleen, where it is retained for days (Zou et al., 2004) , potentially activating marginal-zone B-cell responses. Thus, the filamentous phage is not only a highly immunogenic carrier, but by virtue of activating a range of innate and adaptive immune responses, serves as an excellent model virus-like particle antigen.Long before the identification of filamentous phage, other types of bacteriophage were already being used for antibacterial therapy in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (reviewed in Sulakvelidze et al., 2001) .',\n",
       "  'The filamentous phage, with its nonlytic life cycle, has less obvious clinical uses, despite the fact that the host specificity of Inovirus and Plectrovirus includes many pathogens of medical importance, including Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, and Mycoplasma species.In an effort to enhance their bactericidal activity, genetically modified filamentous phage have been used as a \"Trojan horse\" to introduce various antibacterial agents into cells. M13 and Pf3 phage engineered to express either BglII restriction endonuclease (Hagens and Blasi, 2003; Hagens et al., 2004) , lambda phage S holin (Hagens and Blasi, 2003) or a lethal catabolite gene activator protein (Moradpour et al., 2009) effectively killed E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells, respectively, with no concomitant release of LPS (Hagens and Blasi, 2003; Hagens et al., 2004) . Unfortunately, the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria with modified F pili represents a major and possibly insurmountable obstacle to this approach.',\n",
       "  'However, there are some indications that filamentous phage can exert useful but more subtle effects upon their bacterial hosts that may not result in the development of resistance to infection. Several studies have reported increased antibiotic sensitivity in bacterial populations simultaneously infected with either wild type filamentous phage (Hagens et al., 2006) or phage engineered to repress the cellular SOS response (Lu and Collins, 2009) . Filamentous phage f1 infection inhibited early stage, but not mature, biofilm formation in E. coli (May et al., 2011) . Thus, unmodified filamentous phage may be of future interest as elements of combination therapeutics against certain drug-resistant infections.More advanced therapeutic applications of the filamentous phage emerge when it is modified to express a targeting moiety specific for pathogenic cells and/or proteins for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer and autoimmunity (Figure 2) .',\n",
       "  'The first work in this area showed as proof-of-concept that phage encoding a GFP expression cassette and displaying a HER2specific scFv on all copies of pIII were internalized into breast tumor cells, resulting in GFP expression (Poul and Marks, 1999) . M13 or fd phage displaying either a targeting peptide or antibody fragment and tethered to chloramphenicol by a labile crosslinker were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than high-concentration free chloramphenicol (Yacoby et al., 2006; Vaks and Benhar, 2011) .

Using the B16-OVA tumor model, Eriksson et al. (2007) showed that phage displaying peptides and/or Fabs specific for tumor antigens delayed tumor growth and improved survival, owing in large part to activation of tumor-associated macrophages and recruitment of neutrophils to the tumor site (Eriksson et al., 2009) .',\n",
       "  \"Phage displaying an scFv against β-amyloid fibrils showed promise as a diagnostic (Frenkel and Solomon, 2002) and therapeutic (Solomon, 2008) reagent for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease due to the unanticipated ability of the phage to penetrate into brain tissue (Ksendzovsky et al., 2012) . Similarly, phage displaying an immunodominant peptide epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein depleted pathogenic demyelinating antibodies in brain tissue in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis (Rakover et al., 2010) . The advantages of the filamentous phage in this context over traditional antibody-drug or protein-peptide conjugates are (i) its ability to carry very high amounts of drug or peptide, and (ii) its ability to access anatomical compartments that cannot generally be reached by systemic administration of a protein.Unlike most therapeutic biologics, the filamentous phage's production in bacteria complicates its use in humans in several ways.\",\n",
       "  'First and foremost, crude preparations of filamentous phage typically contain very high levels of contaminating LPS, in the range of ∼10 2 -10 4 endotoxin units (EU)/mL (Boratynski et al., 2004; Branston et al., 2015) , which have the potential to cause severe adverse reactions. LPS is not completely removed by polyethylene glycol precipitation or cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (Smith and Gingrich, 2005; Branston et al., 2015) , but its levels can be reduced dramatically using additional purification steps such as size exclusion chromatography (Boratynski et al., 2004; Zakharova et al., 2005) , polymyxin B chromatography (Grabowska et al., 2000) , and treatment with detergents such as Triton X-100 or Triton X-114 (Roehnisch et al., 2014; Branston et al., 2015) . These strategies routinely achieve endotoxin levels of <1 EU/mL as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, well below the FDA limit for parenteral administration of 5 EU/kg body weight/dose, although concerns remain regarding the presence of residual virion-associated LPS which may be undetectable.',\n",
       "  \"A second and perhaps unavoidable consequence of the filamentous phage's bacterial production is inherent heterogeneity of particle size and the spectrum of host cellderived virion-associated and soluble contaminants, which may be cause for safety concerns and restrict its use to high-risk groups.Many types of bacteriophage and engineered phage variants, including filamentous phage, have been proposed for prophylactic use ex vivo in food safety, either in the production pipeline (reviewed in Dalmasso et al., 2014) or for detection of foodborne pathogens post-production (reviewed in Schmelcher and Loessner, 2014) . Filamentous phage displaying a tetracysteine tag on pIII were used to detect E. coli cells through staining with biarsenical dye . M13 phage functionalized with metallic silver were highly bactericidal against E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis .\",\n",
       "  'Biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (Nanduri et al., 2007) , piezoelectric transducers (Olsen et al., 2006) , linear dichroism (Pacheco-Gomez et al., 2012) , and magnetoelastic sensor technology (Lakshmanan et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009) were devised using filamentous phage displaying scFv or conjugated to whole IgG against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus anthracis with limits of detection on the order of 10 2 -10 6 bacterial cells/mL. Proof of concept has been demonstrated for use of such phage-based biosensors to detect bacterial contamination of live produce (Li et al., 2010b) and eggs (Chai et al., 2012) .The filamentous phage particle is enclosed by a rod-like protein capsid, ∼1000 nm long and 5 nm wide, made up almost entirely of overlapping pVIII monomers, each of which lies ∼27 angstroms from its nearest neighbor and exposes two amine groups as well as at least three carboxyl groups (Henry et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'The regularity of the phage pVIII lattice and its diversity of chemically addressable groups make it an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation (Figure 3) . The most commonly used approach is functionalization of amine groups with NHS esters (van Houten et al., 2006 (van Houten et al., , 2010 Yacoby et al., 2006) , although this can result in unwanted acylation of pIII and any displayed biomolecules. Carboxyl groups and tyrosine residues can also be functionalized using carbodiimide coupling and diazonium coupling, respectively (Li et al., 2010a) . Carrico et al. (2012) developed methods to specifically label pVIII N-termini without modification of exposed lysine residues through a two-step transamination-oxime formation reaction. Specific modification of phage coat proteins is even more easily accomplished using genetically modified phage displaying peptides (Ng et al., 2012) or enzymes (Chen et al., 2007; Hess et al., 2012) , but this can be cumbersome and is less general in application.For more than a decade, interest in the filamentous phage as a building block for nanomaterials has been growing because of its unique physicochemical properties, with emerging applications in magnetics, optics, and electronics.',\n",

       "  'Phagebased nanomaterials have found applications in cancer imaging (Ghosh et al., 2012b; Yi et al., 2012) , photocatalytic water splitting (Nam et al., 2010a; Neltner et al., 2010) , light harvesting (Nam et al., 2010b; Chen et al., 2013) , photoresponsive technologies (Murugesan et al., 2013) , neural electrodes (Kim et al., 2014) , and piezoelectric energy generation (Murugesan et al., 2013) .Thus, the unique physicochemical properties of the phage, in combination with modular display of peptides and proteins with known binding specificity, have spawned wholly novel materials with diverse applications. It is worth noting that the unusual biophysical properties of the filamentous phage can also be exploited in the study of structures of other macromolecules.',\n",
       "  'Magnetic alignment of high-concentration filamentous phage in solution can partially order DNA, RNA, proteins, and other biomolecules for measurement of dipolar coupling interactions (Hansen et al., 1998 (Hansen et al., , 2000 Dahlke Ojennus et al., 1999) in NMR spectroscopy.Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution (reviewed in Husimi, 1989; Wichman and Brown, 2010; Kawecki et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2013) . The filamentous phage has additional practical uses in protein engineering and directed protein evolution, due to its unique tolerance of genetic modifications that allow biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface. First and foremost among these applications is in vitro affinity maturation of antibody fragments displayed on pIII.',\n",
       "  'Libraries of variant Fabs and single chain antibodies can be generated via random or sitedirected mutagenesis and selected on the basis of improved or altered binding, roughly mimicking the somatic evolution strategy of the immune system (Marks et al., 1992; Bradbury et al., 2011) . However, other in vitro display systems, such as yeast display, have important advantages over the filamentous phage for affinity maturation (although each display technology has complementary strengths; Koide and Koide, 2012) , and regardless of the display method, selection of \"improved\" variants can be slow and cumbersome. Iterative methods have been developed to combine computationally designed mutations (Lippow et al., 2007) and circumvent the screening of combinatorial libraries, but these have had limited success to date.Recently, Esvelt et al. (2011) developed a novel strategy for directed evolution of filamentous phage-displayed proteins, called phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), which allows multiple rounds of evolution per day with little experimental intervention.',\n",
       "  'The authors engineered M13 phage to encode an exogenous protein (the subject for directed evolution), whose functional activity triggers gene III expression from an accessory plasmid; variants of the exogenous protein arise by random mutagenesis during phage replication, the rate of which can be increased by inducible expression of error-prone DNA polymerases. By supplying limiting amounts of receptive E. coli cells to the engineered phage variants, Esvelt et al. (2011) elegantly linked phage infectivity and production of offspring with the presence of a desired protein phenotype. Carlson et al. (2014) later showed that PACE selection stringency could be modulated by providing small amounts of pIII independently of protein phenotype, and undesirable protein functions negatively selected by linking them to expression of a truncated pIII variant that impairs infectivity in a dominant negative fashion.',\n",
       "  'PACE is currently limited to protein functions that can be linked in some way to the expression of a gene III reporter, such as protein-protein interaction, recombination, DNA or RNA binding, and enzymatic catalysis (Meyer and Ellington, 2011) . This approach represents a promising avenue for both basic research in molecular evolution (Dickinson et al., 2013) and synthetic biology, including antibody engineering.Filamentous bacteriophage have been recovered from diverse environmental sources, including soil (Murugaiyan et al., 2011) , coastal fresh water (Xue et al., 2012) , alpine lakes (Hofer and Sommaruga, 2001) and deep sea bacteria (Jian et al., 2012) , but not, perhaps surprisingly, the human gut (Kim et al., 2011) . The environmental \"phageome\" in soil and water represent the largest source of replicating DNA on the planet, and is estimated to contain upward of 10 30 viral particles (Ashelford et al., 2003; Chibani-Chennoufi et al., 2004; Suttle, 2005) .',\n",
       "  'The few studies attempting to investigate filamentous phage environmental ecology using classical environmental microbiology techniques (typically direct observation by electron microscopy) found that filamentous phage made up anywhere from 0 to 100% of all viral particles (Demuth et al., 1993; Pina et al., 1998; Hofer and Sommaruga, 2001) . There was some evidence of seasonal fluctuation of filamentous phage populations in tandem with the relative abundance of free-living heterotrophic bacteria (Hofer and Sommaruga, 2001) . Environmental metagenomics efforts are just beginning to unravel the composition of viral ecosystems. The existing data suggest that filamentous phage comprise minor constituents of viral communities in freshwater (Roux et al., 2012) and reclaimed and potable water (Rosario et al., 2009) but have much higher frequencies in wastewater and sewage (Cantalupo et al., 2011; Alhamlan et al., 2013) , with the caveat that biases inherent to the methodologies for ascertaining these data (purification of viral particles, sequencing biases) have not been not well validated.',\n",
       "  'There are no data describing the population dynamics of filamentous phage and their host species in the natural environment.At the individual virus-bacterium level, it is clear that filamentous phage can modulate host phenotype, including the virulence of important human and crop pathogens. This can occur either through direct effects of phage replication on cell growth and physiology, or, more typically, by horizontal transfer of genetic material contained within episomes and/or chromosomally integrated prophage. Temperate filamentous phage may also play a role in genome evolution (reviewed in Canchaya et al., 2003) . Perhaps the best-studied example of virulence modulation by filamentous phage is that of Vibrio cholerae, whose full virulence requires lysogenic conversion by the cholera toxin-encoding CTXφ phage (Waldor and Mekalanos, 1996) . Integration of CTXφ phage occurs at specific sites in the genome; these sequences are introduced through the combined action of another filamentous phage, fs2φ, and a satellite filamentous phage, TLC-Knφ1 (Hassan et al., 2010) .',\n",
       "  'Thus, filamentous phage species interact and coevolve with each other in addition to their hosts. Infection by filamentous phage has been implicated in the virulence of Yersinia pestis (Derbise et al., 2007) , Neisseria meningitidis (Bille et al., 2005 (Bille et al., , 2008 , Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Iida et al., 2001) , E. coli 018:K1:H7 (Gonzalez et al., 2002) , Xanthomonas campestris (Kamiunten and Wakimoto, 1982) , and P. aeruginosa (Webb et al., 2004) , although in most of these cases, the specific mechanisms modulating virulence are unclear. Phage infection can both enhance or repress virulence depending on the characteristics of the phage, the host bacterium, and the environmental milieu, as is the case for the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (Yamada, 2013) .',\n",
       "  'Since infection results in downregulation of the pili used for viral entry, filamentous phage treatment has been proposed as a hypothetical means of inhibiting bacterial conjugation and horizontal gene transfer, so as to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (Lin et al., 2011) .Finally, the filamentous phage may also play a future role in the preservation of biodiversity of other organisms in at-risk ecosystems. Engineered phage have been proposed for use in bioremediation, either displaying antibody fragments of desired specificity for filtration of toxins and environmental contaminants (Petrenko and Makowski, 1993) , or as biodegradable polymers displaying peptides selected for their ability to aggregate pollutants, such as oil sands tailings (Curtis et al., 2011 (Curtis et al., , 2013 . Engineered phage displaying peptides that specifically bind inorganic materials have also been proposed for use in more advanced and less intrusive mineral separation technologies (Curtis et al., 2009 ).The filamentous phage represents a highly versatile organism whose uses extend far beyond traditional phage display and affinity selection of antibodies and polypeptides of desired specificity.',\n",
       "  'Its high immunogenicity and ability to display a variety of surface antigens make the phage an excellent particulate vaccine carrier, although its bacterial production and preparation heterogeneity likely limits its applications in human vaccines at present, despite being apparently safe and well-tolerated in animals and people. Unanticipated characteristics of the phage particle, such as crossing of the blood-brain barrier and formation of highly ordered liquid crystalline phases, have opened up entirely new avenues of research in therapeutics for chronic disease and the design of nanomaterials. Our comparatively detailed understanding of the interactions of model filamentous phage with their bacterial hosts has allowed researchers to harness the phage life cycle to direct protein evolution in the lab. Hopefully, deeper knowledge of phage-host interactions at an ecological level may produce novel strategies to control bacterial pathogenesis.',\n",

       " ['Clostridium difficile is a Gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that can form highly resistant endospores. The bacterium is the causative agent of C. difficile infection (CDI), for which the symptoms can range from a mild diarrhea to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Endospore formation in Firmicutes, including C. difficile, is governed by the key regulator for sporulation, Spo0A. In Bacillus subtilis, this transcription factor is also directly or indirectly involved in various other cellular processes. Here, we report that C. difficile Spo0A shows a high degree of similarity to the well characterized B. subtilis protein and recognizes a similar binding sequence. We find that the laboratory strain C. difficile 630Δerm contains an 18bp-duplication near the DNA-binding domain compared to its ancestral strain 630. In vitro binding assays using purified C-terminal DNA binding domain of the C. difficile Spo0A protein demonstrate direct binding to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, early sporulation genes and several other putative targets.',\n",
       "  'In vitro binding assays suggest that the gene encoding the major clostridial toxin TcdB may be a direct target of Spo0A, but supernatant derived from a spo0A negative strain was no less toxic towards Vero cells than that obtained from a wild type strain, in contrast to previous reports. These results identify for the first time direct (putative) targets of the Spo0A protein in C. difficile and make a positive effect of Spo0A on production of the large clostridial toxins unlikely.Text: Sporulation is an adaptive strategy that enables bacteria to survive harsh environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time, and is an integral part of the transmission of sporulating pathogens and their tolerance and resistance towards antimicrobial compounds.Spo0A is the key regulator for sporulation [1, 2] . Most of our knowledge about the protein is based on work in Bacilli. Spo0A is a response regulator that demonstrates phosphorylation dependent binding to DNA    .',\n",
       "  'Phosphorylation occurs through the concerted action of several proteins that together form a so called phosphorelay  . The signaling cascade allows for the integration of environmental signals into the regulation of Spo0A dependent processes, including sporulation. The two functional domains, the N-terminal phosphorylation and dimerization domain (receiver domain), and the C-terminal DNA binding (effector) domain are separated by a hinge region that is relatively poorly conserved  . Phosphorylation is believed to result in a structural rearrangement that facilitates dimerization [8, 9] , resulting in the disruption of transcription-inhibitory contacts between the receiver and effector domains. The isolated DNA binding domain can bind legitimate targets of the Spo0A protein due to the absence of the transcription inhibitory contacts, thereby bypassing the need for phosphorylation  . Extensive characterization of Spo0A targets has revealed a motif that represents a high affinity Spo0A binding site, the 0A box [10, 11] .',\n",
       "  'The crystal structure of the DNA binding domain confirms specific and non-specific contacts between the protein and the consensus sequence [12, 13] . It is noteworthy that Spo0A regulates many other processes than sporulation, such as competence for genetic transformation, DNA replication, and biofilm formation in B. subtilis    , virulence factors and stress responses in for instance B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis      , and solvent production in Clostridium acetobutylicum [22, 23] .C. difficile is a Gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that is the causative agent of C. difficile infection (CDI) (for recent reviews see [24, 25] ). Though many people are asymptomatically colonized by C. difficile, the bacterium can cause serious health problems, such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon, under the influence of risk factors such as age and antibiotic use. As a result, CDI was long regarded a nosocomial infection. Recently, however, an increase in the cases of community acquired CDI can be observed  .',\n",
       "  'Outbreaks of CDI have been linked to so called hypervirulent strains, such as PCR ribotypes 027 (BI/ NAP1) and 078 [27, 28] . Its main virulence factors are the major clostridial toxins A and B [29, 30] . In addition, certain strains of C. difficile, including ribotypes 027 and 078, additionally encode a binary toxin [31, 32] . C. difficile is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is believed that spores are crucial to successfully infect new hosts, as they are able to withstand the harsh environment of the stomach, and survive antibiotic treatments that alter the endogenous flora, after which C. difficile can overgrow [24, 25] .There is limited knowledge about the regulation of sporulation in C. difficile. It has been reported that spo0A, as expected, is required for the formation of spores  and the gene is required for persistence and transmission in mice  .',\n",
       "  'Though the pathways downstream of Spo0A seem to a large extent conserved between B. subtilis and Clostridia, this is less so for the pathways leading to activation of Spo0A  . It has been suggested that the orphan histidine kinase CD2492 is involved in the activation of Spo0A  . Similarly, it was reported that multiple orphan histidine kinases can phosphorylate Spo0A in C. acetobutylicum  . Recently, it was reported that spo0A can be transcribed from a SigH-dependent promoter  . It is unknown which genes are regulated by direct binding of Spo0A to their upstream regions.Here, we establish an in vitro binding assay for C. difficile Spo0A and demonstrate for the first time direct binding of this transcription factor to DNA upstream of several putative target genes.Escherichia coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani broth or plates, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.

Analogously, we purified the C. difficile Spo0A-DBD for use in in vitro binding assays. As no direct targets for the C. difficile protein have been reported so far, we used the upstream region of the abrB gene (PabrB) of B. subtilis. PabrB is commonly used as a high-affinity control in binding assays with the B. subtilis Spo0A or Spo0A-DBD protein [43, 44] . It is noteworthy that we failed to identify a homolog of abrB in C. difficile using BLAST, indicating that potential indirect regulation by Spo0A cannot occur through abrB in C. difficile as it does in B. subtilis.',\n",

We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using radiolabeled PabrB and increasing amounts of purified C. difficile Spo0A-DBD that was purified using a C-terminal 66His-tag. The addition of protein leads to a dose-dependent retardation of the DNA fragment with an apparent K D of ,50 nM. In the same range of protein concentrations, no binding was observed for a negative control (a DNA fragment of B. subtilis citG  ) (Fig. 2E) , suggesting that binding was specific for the abrB promoter region.B. subtilis Spo0A recognizes a distinct sequence (0A box), that is characterized by a 7 bp core motif (TGTCGAA) [10, 11] . Structural studies have revealed that the protein makes specific contacts with the G at position 2 (G2), and the C at position 4 (C4) and 5 (G5) of this motif  .',\n",
       "  'We introduced G2A, C4A, G5A, G2A/C4A and C4A/G5A mutations in the perfect consensus core 0A-box present in PabrB. We found that the affinity of C. difficile Spo0A for these mutated PabrB fragments was highly reduced (Fig. 2E) . We performed EMSAs using radiolabeled PabrB containing the mutated core sequence. For the single point mutations in the DNA, the affinity decreased ,10-fold. There did not seem to be an additive effect of a second point mutation for the two combinations tested. None of the mutations abolished binding of C. difficile Spo0A completely, most likely as the result of binding of Spo0A to other (non-consensus) 0A boxes in the abrB promoter  .Taken together, we conclude that the guanine and cytosine residues in the core TGTCGAA motif of PabrB are important for specific binding of this fragment by C. difficile Spo0A-DBD.Value for Binding by C. difficile Spo0A-DBD Above, we have established that the Spo0A-DBD of C. difficile is highly homologous to that of the B. subtilis Spo0A protein, and that the proteins recognize a similar consensus sequence (Fig.',\n",
       "  '2 ). Based on this information, we identified the several genes as putative direct targets of C. difficile Spo0A.We queried the C. difficile 630 genome sequence for perfect matches to the core 0A box using Genome2D  . Such an analysis revealed the presence of 102 matching motifs, of which 45 were located within 500 bp of the initiating ATG of an open reading frame on the same strand (see Table S1 ). Our attention was drawn to spo0A and sigH, as these two genes were previously found to be regulated by Spo0A in B. subtilis and/or play important roles in sporulation [3,    . We found that C. difficile Spo0A bound to DNA sequences upstream of spo0A and sigH.We performed EMSAs with DNA encompassing 220-281 bp upstream of the initiating ATG codon of the spo0A, sigH and spoVG open reading frames.',\n",
       "  'We found that the addition of Spo0A-DBD to the reactions caused retardation of the spo0A and sigH DNA fragments (Fig. 3A) , but not of a spoVG fragment which did not contain a consensus 0A box (Fig. 3B) . It should be noted that the affinity of Spo0A-DBD for the region upstream of spo0A was the highest we have observed so far for any C. difficile DNA. Moreover, the presence of multiple shifted species could indicate the presence of more than one strong binding site. These results establish that spo0A and sigH are likely legitimate targets of Spo0A in C. difficile, and confirm that spoVG is not, in line with results obtained in B. subtilis  .We were interested to see if Spo0A in C. difficile could potentially regulate genes that have no documented function in sporulation. Our in silico analysis identified several genes with no obvious link to sporulation that had a consensus 0A box within 100 bp upstream of their start codon.',\n",
       "  'This positioning is similar to that observed for spo0A (275) and sigH (278). We confirmed in vitro binding of the C. difficile Spo0A-DBD to the promoter regions of lplA and ssuA.We carried out EMSA experiments using probes that included the perfect consensus site and purified Spo0A-DBD protein. We observed binding of the protein to fragments upstream of the lplA gene (CD1654; box at 267) and the ssuA gene (CD1484; box at 282) (Fig. 3A) . The lplA gene encodes a predicted lipoate-protein ligase, and ssuA is annotated as an aliphatic sulfonates ABC transporter; to our knowledge, neither of these have been directly implicated in sporulation or have found to be targets for Spo0A in other organisms.Together our results establish the potential for binding of Spo0A to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, two genes that are important for sporulation, and indicate that Spo0A may have functions that go beyond the regulation of sporulation in C. difficile.It has been established that a spo0A mutant of C. difficile does not produce any spores, consistent with a crucial role in the sporulation pathway  .',\n",
       "  'However, the in silico identification of upstream regions with a consensus Spo0A binding site did not point to any of the early sporulation genes (downstream of spo0A itself) as direct targets of Spo0A. This is likely the result of variations in the 0A-box in these promoters that were disregarded in the box search. In support of this, many well-characterized legitimate direct targets of B. subtilis Spo0A (such as spoIIAA and spoIIE) do not contain a 100% match to the core motif, but rather one or more near-consensus boxes [5, 49] . We found that Spo0A- We performed EMSA experiments using increasing amounts of purified Spo0A-DBD from C. difficile 630Derm and the DNA fragments indicated above (Fig. 3B ). For spoIIAA (encoding an antianti sigma-factor) and spoIIE (encoding a serine phosphatase), we observed a low intensity shifted species at concentrations as low as 150 nM.',\n",
       "  'For spoIIGA (encoding a sporulation specific protease) we observed the shifted species only at higher concentrations of protein (.200 nM). The negative control (spoVG) did not demonstrate binding of Spo0A-DBD at these concentrations. Moreover, the shift we observed was reversible using unlabeled DNA containing a high affinity binding site, but not using unlabeled DNA that lacked such a site ( Figure S1B-D) . Therefore, we consider the binding to spoIIAA, spoIIE and spoIIGA genes to be specific, despite the fact that increasing the amount of protein did not seem to cause a significant increase in the amount of DNA in the complex.Together, these results suggest that Spo0A in C. difficile might regulate the transcription of at least a subset of early sporulation genes by direct binding to their promoter regions.C.',\n",
       "  'difficile Spo0A-DBD Binds to DNA Upstream of tcdB It has previously been reported that the deletion of Spo0A in C. difficile results in a significantly lower toxin production and a ,1000-fold reduction in the toxicity of culture supernatant derived from spo0A negative cells towards Vero cells  . Considering the absence of a homolog of the abrB repressor, direct binding of Spo0A and concomitant activation of toxin gene transcription is a likely mechanism through which this could occur. We found evidence for direct binding of Spo0A-DBD to the region upstream of tcdB, encoding one of the major clostridial toxin genes, and possibly tcdC, but this did not seem to result in lower toxin levels in our hands.We performed EMSAs using DNA upstream of tcdR (encoding a sigma factor responsible for the activation of toxin gene transcription), tcdB (encoding toxin B), tcdA (encoding toxin A).',\n",
       "  'In order to test regions upstream of all open reading frames in the PaLoc, we also tested binding of Spo0A to DNA upstream of tcdE (encoding a holin-like protein [50, 51] ) and tcdC (encoding a putative negative regulator of toxin production    ), even though this regulator does not have a significant effect on toxin levels under the conditions we used [55, 56] . Of the regions tested, we only observed a clear shifted species, indicative of Spo0A binding, for tcdB ( Figure 4A ); the shifted species in our EMSA assay was reversed by the addition of unlabeled DNA containing a high affinity binding site, but not by DNA lacking such a site ( Figure S1E ). For tcdC, some smearing was observed at all concentrations of proteins tested ( Figure 4A ), and there did not seem to be a clear effect of the addition of unlabeled DNA fragments ( Figure S1F ).',\n",
       "  'The probes for tcdA, tcdE and tcdR were indistinguishable from those obtained with our negative control, spoVG.We wanted to determine if toxin levels in culture supernatants were directly or indirectly affected by Spo0A, as was previously suggested. We found no lower toxicity towards Vero cells of culture supernatants derived from spo0A mutant cells compared to wild type.We grew three independent biological replicates of a wild type (630Derm) or Clostron-generated spo0A mutant (CT::spo0A -a kind gift of the Minton lab) in glucose-free TTY medium. We harvested culture supernatant at late-exponential phase (approximately 7 hours post inoculation), the transition phase between exponential and stationary growth phase (approximately 9 hours post inoculation), as well as two time points in stationary phase (24 and 48 hours post inoculation) and determined the toxin endpoint titres (see Materials and Methods).',\n",
       "  'In contrast to previous findings, we observed a small (#4-fold) increase in the toxicity of supernatants derived from spo0A mutant cells compared to wild type, but in all cases this difference was not statistically significant (p.0.05, independent sample t-test). In other medium (BHIS), we observed no differences at all (data not shown).We conclude that Spo0A does not positively affect toxin production in C. difficile 630Derm and the in vivo relevance of the binding to regions upstream of tcdB and/or tcdC is therefore limited under our experimental conditions.The Spo0A-box of C. difficile In B. subtilis, the binding site of Spo0A on target DNA has been well-characterized, through a combination of in vitro binding assays, determination of in vivo binding profiles and mutagenesis of regulated promoter sequences. This work has led to the identification of a conserved core motif, TGTCGAA, or Spo0A box [5, 10, 11, 45] .',\n",
       "  'Depending on the analysis, this motif is flanked by one or more adenine or thymine residues [10, 11] . Interestingly, many target genes do not harbor a perfect match to this consensus sequence, but rather contain one or more degenerate motifs. The differences in these motifs may reflect different promoter architectures (e.g. AT content), modes of action (e.g. activation or repression) or levels of regulation. Spo0A genes in B. subtilis can be divided in different classes that respond to different levels of phosphorylated Spo0A [43, 57] .For C. difficile, we conclude that the Spo0A protein likely recognizes a motif that is similar to the B. subtilis Spo0A box on the basis of four lines of evidence; 1. All DNA binding/contacting residues are conserved (Fig. 2B) , 2. C. difficile Spo0A can bind with high affinity to a target of B. subtilis Spo0A (Fig. 2D) , 3.',\n",
       "  'Mutagenesis of key residues in the B. subtilis Spo0A box reduces affinity of C. difficile Spo0A for DNA (Fig. 2E ) and 4. A B. subtilis Spo0A box has predictive value for DNA binding by C. difficile Spo0A (Fig. 3A) . It is conceivable that our model system, using the purified DNA binding domain, does not accurately reflect binding to all target sites, if target site selectivity is determined in part by other parts by of the full length protein. It is likely that differences do exist between the preferred binding sites for both proteins that will be evident when a comprehensive analysis is performed of in vivo DNA binding of C. difficile Spo0A; based on the limited data set of this study, a MEME analysis  already suggests possible differences in the extended Spo0A motif (W.K. Smits, unpublished observations).',\n",
       "  'These differences may relate to the much higher AT content of C. difficile compared to B. subtilis (71 vs. 56.5%, respectively), or phosphorylation dependent dimerization, for instance.The initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis is subject to complex regulation (for review see ref [1, 59] ). The activation of Spo0A is controlled by a multi-component phosphorelay that can integrate environmental cues  and ensures a gradual increase in the level of phosphorylated Spo0A in the cell  . In addition, the transcription of the spo0A gene is controlled by multiple feedback loops. For instance, Spo0A regulates its own transcription by binding to the spo0A promoter  , as well as by indirectly stimulating the transcription of sigH, encoding a sigma factor that recognizes the spo0A promoter  .In C. difficile, there are some interesting differences and similarities in the regulatory pathways. Most notably, there seems to be no phosphorelay  and the phosphorylation state of Spo0A is supposedly controlled by orphan histidine kinases  .',\n",
       "  'The transcription of spo0A in C. difficile is under control of the transition state sigma factor Sigma H  , as it is in B. subtilis  . Our data indicate that both spo0A and sigH could be targets for direct regulation by Spo0A in C. difficile (Fig. 3A) , raising the possibility of auto-regulation of spo0A. The putative direct regulation of sigH by Spo0A may reflect that the C. difficile genome does not harbor a homolog of the pleiotropic regulator AbrB, which is responsible for the Spo0A-dependent regulation of sigH in B. subtilis  . Consistent with a model in which spo0A is positively autoregulated, we noted a sharp increase in the levels of Spo0A as cells approach the stationary growth phase ( Figure 1C) .Downstream of Spo0A, we found binding of Spo0A to DNA upstream of several early sporulation genes, such as spoIIAA, spoIIE, and spoIIGA (Fig. 3B ).',\n",
       "  'All these observations are consistent with direct regulation of these genes by Spo0A in other organisms [5, 45, 49, 62] , and the conservation of the sporulation pathway  .Though Spo0A is the key regulator for sporulation in Firmicutes, it regulates numerous other processes in various bacteria. In the non-pathogenic B. subtilis, for instance, the protein also affects competence development, biofilm formation, the production of and resistance to antimicrobial compounds, chromosome dynamics and aspects of phage biology [10,    . Importantly, several of these processes are indirectly regulated, through the Spo0A-dependent repression of abrB. Additionally, transcription of abrB responds already to low levels of Spo0A,P  . As a result these effects are detectable in late-exponential and early stationary phase, as some Spo0A is present throughout growth in B. subtilis cells.Though abrB is absent from C. difficile, this does not exclude the possibility of indirect transcriptional regulation through Spo0Adependent effects on other regulators.',\n",
       "  'Alternatively, Spo0A may exert a direct effect. In Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii, Spo0A is a direct regulator of solvent formation, as well as sporulation [22, 23] . It seems therefore conceivable that Spo0A in C. difficile also affects aspects of metabolism. In this respect, it is important to note that also in C. difficile Spo0A is detectable from early exponential growth phase on ( Figure 1B) .We observed direct binding of C. difficile Spo0A to the promoter region of sigH (Fig. 3A) . This gene encodes the key sigma factor for the transition phase, and regulates processes outside sporulation as well  . Moreover, we found significant levels of Spo0A from early stationary phase on ( Fig. 1B and unpublished observations) , indicating the regulatory actions of Spo0A need not be limited to stationary phase in C. difficile.',\n",
       "  'In line with this idea, we found a potential regulatory link between Spo0A and two genes that to our knowledge are not related to the sporulation process, the lipoate ligase lplA and the aliphatic sulfonates transporter ssuA (Fig. 3A) . The presence of a putative Spo0A binding site upstream of these genes, as well as the spacing compared to the start codon, is conserved in the problematic Stoke-Mandeville strain (R20291), a member of PCR ribotype 27. This could indicate that these aspects of regulation by Spo0A are conserved in multiple strains of C. difficile.It should be noted that our work so far has been limited to an in vitro analysis of Spo0A binding, and therefore does not indicate whether activation or repression of the putative target genes occurs in vivo. To answer this question, detailed transcriptome and/or proteome studies have to be performed.',\n",
       "  'In order to distinguish direct from indirect effects, in vivo binding profiles of Spo0A should be performed. The antibodies generated for this study should prove to be useful for this type of experiments.Amongst the pathogenic Firmicutes, Spo0A has been reported to affect toxin production in multiple species. In B. anthracis a spo0A mutation results in elevated levels of AbrB, and concomitantly lower levels of the toxin genes pagA, cya and lef that are under AbrB control  . Similarly, the production of the emetic toxin cereulide in B. cereus is greatly repressed in a spo0A mutant, in an AbrB-dependent manner  . In contrast, Spo0A directly represses the expression of the cry toxin genes in B. thuringiensis and a spo0A mutant is therefore a hyper-producer of the insecticidal crystal protein [18, 21] .',\n",
       "  'In Clostridium perfringens TpeL, a member of the large clostridial toxins just like TcdA and TcdB, is directly dependent on Spo0A  and also the production of enterotoxin in this organism seems to be (indirectly) dependent on sporulation [65, 66] .In C. difficile an insertional spo0A mutant generated using Clostron technology was reported to have ,10-fold reduced levels of toxin A (TcdA), both intracellularly and extracellularly as well as ,1000-fold reduced toxicity towards Vero cells, which are primarily sensitive towards toxin B (TcdB)  . Our in vitro binding data indicate a potential binding site for Spo0A upstream of tcdB and possibly tcdC (Fig. 4A) . However, the in vivo relevance of this binding seems limited as in our hands an independently derived but otherwise identical mutant (a kind gift of the Minton lab;  ) did not demonstrate a reduced toxicity towards Vero cells.',\n",
       "  'In contrast, we found that in TTY medium toxin levels were slightly elevated in spo0A mutant cells compared to wild type (#2fold in exponential phase cells up to 4-fold in late-stationary phase cells). The small, and not significant, differences in toxin levels in our experiments might be attributed to differences in the susceptibility of cells for lysis rather than the production of toxin, but could also indicate a negative regulatory effect of Spo0A on toxin production. In support of the latter hypothesis, it was recently reported that a spo0A mutant of C. difficile strain R20291 (a PCR ribotypes 027/BI/NAP1 epidemic strain) demonstrates ,10fold higher toxin levels than its isogenic wild type 30 h post inoculation, and is significantly more virulent in a mouse model of disease  .The differences between Underwood et al  on the one hand and our study as well as the study of Deakin and coworkers  on the other hand may be explained by differences in experimental conditions, such as the medium used.',\n",
       "  'However, we observed no difference in cytotoxicity between supernatant derived from wild type or spo0A mutant cells when they were grown in BHIS, a medium nearly identical to that used previously (data not shown). Alternatively, the differences could indicate integration of the group II intron at more than one location in the chromosome in the strain used in Underwood et al  . In the absence of a complementation experiment and/or Southern blot data, this remains to be established.In summary, our data are consistent with a model in which the regulation of the major clostridial toxins in C. difficile is not positively affected by Spo0A, in contrast to previous findings and other pathogenic Clostridia. Whether Spo0A is truly a negative regulator of toxin production remains to be confirmed using in vitro and in vivo transcription assays.In the present study we have for the first time demonstrated direct binding of the DNA binding domain of C. difficile Spo0A to putative target DNA.',\n",
       "  'This work has revealed that aspects of Spo0A binding are conserved between Bacillus and C. difficile (0A box, possible auto-regulation and binding to early sporulation promoters), whereas others are not (the absence of abrB as a direct target in C. difficile, binding to DNA upstream of lplA, ssuA). The effects of Spo0A on toxin production may be similar to those observed for B. thuringiensis [18, 21] . Future work will be aimed at determining the effect of Spo0A on the transcription of the putative target genes, and carry out a comprehensive analysis of Spo0A binding in vivo. The identification of genes affected by Spo0A in C. difficile may shed light on the role of the protein in virulence and pathogenesis of this organism.Figure S1 Specificity controls for binding by Spo0A-DBD-his6.

The increased circulation and spread in the Americas of VEEV and other encephalitic arboviruses, such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, underscore the need for research aimed at characterizing the pathogenesis of viral encephalomyelitis for the development of novel medical countermeasures. The host-pathogen dynamics of VEEV Trinidad donkey-infected human astrocytoma U87MG cells were determined by carrying out RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) and mRNAs. To identify the critical alterations that take place in the host transcriptome following VEEV infection, samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection and RNA-Seq data were acquired using an Ion Torrent PGM platform.

EGR1(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated lower susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death than isogenic wild-type MEFs, indicating that EGR1 modulates proapoptotic pathways following VEEV infection. The influence of EGR1 is of great importance, as neuronal damage can lead to long-term sequelae in individuals who have survived VEEV infection. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses represent a group of clinically relevant viruses transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. In severe cases, viral spread targets neuronal tissue, resulting in significant and life-threatening inflammation dependent on a combination of virus-host interactions.

VEEV is a positive-strand RNA virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes and that is naturally present in rodent reservoirs (1) . There are six subtypes that are categorized by their geographic range and pathology in equines and humans. The two epizootic strains, IA/B and IC, arose from mutations among the enzootic strains (2) .',\n",
       "  'The IA/B and IC strains are of particular concern due to increased rates of morbidity and mortality and the risks associated with viral amplification and potential species spillover (2) . In humans, VEEV causes a febrile illness typified by fever, malaise, and vomiting. In some cases, infection progresses to the central nervous system (CNS) and neurological symptoms, such as confusion, ataxia, and seizures, manifest. The mortality rate among cases with neurological symptoms can be as high as 35% in children and 10% in adults, with long-term neurological deficits often being seen in survivors (2) . In 1995, an outbreak of VEEV in Colombia and Venezuela resulted in over 100,000 human cases (3) . In addition to natural outbreaks, VEEV is also a concern from a bioterrorism perspective, as it can be grown to high titers, requires a low infectious dose, and contains multiple serotypes.',\n",
       "  'Both the former Soviet Union and the United States previously weaponized the virus, producing large quantities for their now defunct offensive bioweapons programs (4) . Currently, vaccine strain TC83 is used in horses and for high-risk personnel; however, due to the low rate of seroconversion achieved with this vaccine (5) and its reliance on two single attenuating mutations (6) , it is considered unfit for mass distribution (7) . To date there are no FDA-approved therapeutics for VEEV infection, and further studies are required for clarification of the mechanisms associated with the underlying pathogenesis of VEEV.Viral and host transcriptomic studies can provide a wealth of information on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and interactions following the course of an infection. The use of highthroughput next-generation sequencing has led to the discovery of previously uncharacterized viruses and the establishment of numerous novel experimental systems redefining virus-host interactions.',\n",

A study examining the role of adhesion and inflammatory factors in VEEV-infected CD-1 mice found viral modulation of the expression of extracellular matrix and adhesion genes, such as integrins (Itg␣X, Itg2, 3, and 7), cadherins 1 and 2, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), in the brains of VEEV-infected mice (10) .',\n",

A second study by the same group identified the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brains of VEEV-infected mice, which enabled the correlation of the miRNA changes with earlier mRNA expression data (11, 12) .

Following read trimming, the reads were mapped to human genome hg19 with the following RNA-Seq parameters: a 10-hit limit for multiple mapped positions, a similarity fraction of 0.8, a length fraction of 0.8, a mismatch cost of 2, and an indel cost of 3. The expression level of individual genes and transcripts was calculated using the number of reads per kilobase of the exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) method of Mortazavi et al. (19) .

Principal component analysis of the resulting filtered data set (13,906 genes in total) was carried out using raw counts of uniquely mapped reads (see Fig. 2A ).

First, the empirical analysis of differential gene expression algorithm, part of the edgeR Bioconductor package (21) , was applied to the integrated data set of all 18 experiments using the default parameters and a false discovery rate-corrected P value. At each time point, infected and mock-infected samples were compared, and genes whose expression differed by more than 2-fold with a significance with a P value of Յ0.05 were provisionally considered to be differentially expressed.In addition to the method described above, an orthogonal statistical test of differential expression was applied to the data using a statistical test developed by Baggerly et al.',\n",

Differentially expressed genes found to be in the intersection of the sets of genes identified by both of the methods outlined above were considered high-quality candidates and used as the starting point for further investigation.Clustering and GSEA. Filtered, normalized expression data were subjected to k-means clustering using a Euclidian distance metric where genes were grouped by means of normalized gene expression (RPKM) values for each experimental condition.

VEEV replicates in vivo in monocytes, macrophages, neurons, and astrocytes (14) . Common cell lines used to study VEEV infection include Vero and BHK cells; in this study, U87MG astrocytes were chosen as an in vitro model due to their physiological relevance and greater clinical significance. Initial experiments were performed to characterize viral replication in U87MG cells. VEEV replication kinetics in U87MG cells were measured using plaque assays and by monitoring viral protein and RNA expression levels and the cytopathic effect (CPE) on the infected cells (Fig. 1) .',\n",

Viral replication peaked at 16 hpi, and no additional increase in viral titers was observed at 24 hpi. Viral capsid expression followed a similar pattern, with protein being detected at 8 hpi and expression plateauing at 16 hpi (Fig. 1B) . Among infected U87MG cells, a significant CPE was observed by microscopy at 24 hpi, with little to no CPE being detected at 16 hpi (data not shown). Consistent with these observations, increased caspase 3/7 activity was observed only at 24 hpi (Fig. 1C) . On the basis of these data, times of 4, 8, and 16 hpi, reflecting the early, middle, and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively, were selected for RNA-Seq analysis in order to provide a dynamic view of the host-pathogen transcriptome profile.RNA sequencing analysis of VEEV-infected astrocytes.',\n",

A high-level summary of the RNA-Seq results is shown in Table 1 . VEEV RNA samples were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR at each time point as a control to demonstrate the increasing viral RNA load over time (Fig. 1D) , consistent with the increasing number of RNA-Seq reads mapped to the VEEV genome at later time points (Table 1) .For RNA-Seq analysis, individual genes were expressed as the number of reads per kilobase of the exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) (19) .

In addition, intersample variation was also found to be minimal when it was tested pairwise across the entire experiment by using RPKM values for ERCC97 synthetic spike-in control RNAs (R 2 Ͼ 0.90 for all comparisons; data not shown).As anticipated, two-component principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq data for mock-infected cells versus VEEV-infected cells showed a clear separation of the samples at 16 hpi from the samples at earlier time points (Fig. 2B) . However, the clustering of VEEV-infected samples with mock-infected samples at earlier time points suggested that the response to viral infection was limited to a narrow subset of early response genes, thus placing a higher burden of proof on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the first few hours of infection.',\n",
       "  'Along these lines, two orthogonal methods were used to identify DEGs suitable for further characterization: the edgeR method (21) and the method developed by Baggerly et al. (22) . Genes identified by one method were provisionally considered DEGs, and those identified by both methods were candidate DEGs to be confirmed by qRT-PCR. In addition to comparing individual gene expression values for mock-infected cells and VEEV-infected cells at each time point, gene expression values were also compared serially within each time series of VEEV-infected cells for genes that did not show any statistically significant changes in expression in mock-infected cells. A schematic of the comparative analysis is shown in Fig. 2C . The number of statistically significant DEGs identified by each of these comparisons is shown in Fig. 2D . Furthermore, k-means clustering (against normalized RPKM values) was employed to identify gross changes in gene expression over time for cohorts of genes potentially sharing the same pathway or regulatory triggers ( Fig.',\n",
       "  '3 ; see also Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; see Material and Methods and Data Set S3 in the supplemental material) was carried out on each kmeans cluster. In particular, cluster 20 (Table 2) was significantly enriched for genes involved in translational control, the type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (GSEA P value Ͻ 0.01). Although there is a well-established connection between translational control and UPR, a novel connection between UPR and the type I interferonmediated response in response to viral replication was suggested by pathway analysis (see Materials and Methods), implicating early growth response 1 (EGR1) as a potential bridge between these two pathways (Fig. 4) . EGR1 belongs to cluster 20 and is strongly induced during VEEV infection, and several other genes associated with the interferon response belong to the same cluster: IRF1, IFIT1, IFIT2, ISG15, and ILF3.',\n",

Consequently, 15 genes from this analysis were selected for further characterization by qRT-PCR (see below): ATF3, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CEBPB, CEBPD, DDIT3/CHOP, EGR1, FOS, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, ISG20, JUN, and OASL. The expression values of these genes, as measured by RNA-Seq, are shown in Fig. 5A and B. Confirmatory qRT-PCR analysis indicated concordant gene expression ( Fig. 5C and D) . The interferon response genes induced are in agreement with those detected in previously published studies (11, 29, 30) , and these genes served as an internal positive control. Moreover, the link between EGR1 and the interferon pathway has been demonstrated; EGR1 is induced by IFN-␥ in mouse fibroblasts and by IFN-␣, -␤, and -␥ in human fibroblasts (31, 32) .',\n",
       "  'EGR1 and the UPR pathway were selected for further analysis, as their role in VEEV infection has not been elucidated.The RNA-Seq and pathway analysis data indicated that UPR and stress response genes were induced after VEEV infection. During an infection, host cells respond to cellular stresses resulting from increased viral protein translation and secretion by triggering the onset of the UPR pathway. The UPR pathway is an adaptive cellular response activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to protein misfolding. In order to regulate cellular homeostasis during protein folding and secretion, the UPR pathway has developed three classes of sensors to ensure proper cellular regulation: inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (33, 34) . During VEEV infection, the PERK arm of the UPR appeared to be altered, as two critical regulators of this pathway were differentially expressed: ATF4 and CHOP (DDIT3) (35) .',\n",
       "  'To determine if DEGs altered subsequent protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed for CHOP, ATF4, and phosphorylated eIF2␣ (p-eIF2␣). Tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor and inducer of UPR (36) , was included as a positive control. A time course analysis of U87MG cells treated with 1 M tunicamycin indicated that 8 h of treatment provided the most robust induction of UPR proteins (data not shown). VEEV-infected but not mock-infected or UV-inactivated VEEV (UV-VEEV)-infected cells displayed a dramatic increase in p-eIF2␣ expression and a modest but consistent increase in CHOP and ATF4 expression at 16 hpi (Fig. 6A) . No change in protein expression was observed at 4 hpi (data not shown). Confocal microscopy confirmed CHOP and ATF4 up- regulation, demonstrating a more robust and nuclear staining pattern in VEEV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells (Fig. 6C to E). While ATF4 protein expression levels increased, ATF4 mRNA abundances decreased following VEEV infection ( Fig.',\n",
       "  '5B and D). These results are consistent with the observation that ATF4 expression is regulated at the translational level upon UPR induction (37) . As eIF2␣ can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases (PERK, protein kinase double-stranded RNA dependent [PKR], general control nonderepressible-2 [GCN2], and hemeregulated inhibitor [HRI]) (38) , the PERK inhibitor (PERKi) GSK2606414 was used to determine if the observed phosphorylation was PERK dependent. Treatment of VEEV-infected cells with PERKi resulted in a marked decrease in eIF2␣ phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) . These results indicate that PERK contributes to eIF2␣ phosphorylation but that there is likely an additional kinase contributing to the phosphorylation event. Collectively, these findings indicate that the PERK arm of the UPR pathway is induced at later time points following VEEV infection.EGR1 is upregulated in infected cells and localizes to the nucleus. EGR1 is a transcription factor that can be induced by numerous signals, including oxidative stress, hypoxemia, and growth factors (39, 40) .',\n",
       "  'It can also be activated upon infection by both DNA and RNA viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, mouse hepatitis virus, murine coronavirus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (41) (42) (43) . Treatment of MEFs with the UPR activator thapsigargin has been shown to induce EGR1 expression in a PERK-dependent manner (44) . Given the link between EGR1 and UPR and the robust induction of EGR1 mRNA expression following VEEV infection ( Fig. 4 and 5) , EGR1 was chosen for further study. EGR1 protein expression after VEEV infection was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As previous studies have indicated that EGR1 can be activated by mouse hepatitis virus independently of virus replication (likely due to cellular membrane disruption following entry) (41), a UV-inactivated virus control (UV-VEEV) was included. EGR1 protein levels were increased following VEEV infection compared to those in mock-infected cells and UV-VEEV-infected cells (Fig. 7A; compare lanes 3, 6, and 9 ).',\n",
       "  'The most dramatic upregulation of EGR1 occurred at 16 hpi; this correlates with the highest levels of VEEV capsid production (Fig. 1B) . Following induction, EGR1 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus to induce gene expression through binding to the Egr binding sequence (EBS) [GCG(G/T)GGCG] (40, 45) . Confocal microcopy revealed high levels of EGR1 in the nuclei of infected cells, whereas only low levels of both nuclear and cytoplasmic EGR1 were detected in mock-infected cells (Fig. 7B) . PERKi treatment of VEEV-infected cells resulted in a complete loss of EGR1 induction (Fig. 7C) , indicating that EGR1 was induced in a PERK-dependent fashion. These results demonstrate that EGR1 protein levels and nuclear localization are increased following VEEV infection and that the induction of EGR1 is dependent on PERK.The loss of EGR1 inhibits VEEV-induced apoptosis but does not alter VEEV replication kinetics.',\n",
       "  'As EGR1 influences cell survival and apoptosis (46) , the impact of EGR1 on VEEV-induced cell death was assessed. Caspase 3 cleavage was observed in WT MEFs at 24 hpi when they were infected at an MOI of 0.5 and started as early as 16 hpi when they were infected at an MOI of 5 (Fig. 8A ). In contrast, EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ cells showed little to no detectable caspase cleavage following infection with VEEV. Two sets of experiments were performed to quantitatively confirm these results: CellTiter Glo assays to measure total cell viability (ATP production) and Caspase 3/7 Glo assays to measure caspase 3/7 activity. Both WT and EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs displayed dose-dependent decreases in cell viability following VEEV infection, with EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ cells having significantly more viable cells at each MOI examined (Fig. 8B) .',\n",
       "  'Concordantly, a dose-dependent increase in caspase 3/7 activity was observed following VEEV infection, with EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ cells demonstrating reduced caspase 3 activity at MOIs of 0.5 and 5 (Fig. 8C) . These results were replicated in U87MG cells transfected with siRNA targeting EGR1 (Fig. 8D) . EGR1 has been shown to negatively regulate the transcription of BIRC5 (survivin), an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family member (47) . RNA-Seq data indicated that BIRC5 gene expression was decreased following VEEV infection: log 2 -transformed fold change values of normalized gene expression were Ϫ1.16, Ϫ1.18, and Ϫ1.50 at 4, 8, and 16 hpi, respectively (see Table S1 in the supplemental material and NCBI BioProject accession number PRJNA300864). WT and EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs were used to determine if EGR1 influenced BIRC5 gene expression following VEEV infection. BIRC5 expression was significantly decreased at 16 hpi in VEEV-infected WT MEFs, but this reduction was not observed in VEEV-infected EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs (Fig.',\n",
       "  '8E) . Ex-pression of the gene for the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), another IAP family member, was not significantly differentially altered after infection (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that EGR1 contributes to VEEV-induced apoptosis.VEEV replication kinetics were determined for both EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ and WT MEFs to determine the relevance of EGR1 in viral replication. Cells were infected at two different MOIs (0.5 and 5), and viral supernatants were collected at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hpi and analyzed by plaque assay. The replication kinetics were similar between EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ and WT MEFs at both MOIs, with titers peaking at 16 hpi (Fig. 9A) . A lack of EGR1 expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 9B) . These results were replicated in U87MG cells transfected with siRNA targeting EGR1. Transfection of siRNA targeting EGR1 resulted in a Ͼ90% decrease in EGR1 protein expression (Fig.',\n",
       "  '9D ) without any significant effect on viral replication (Fig. 9C) . These results suggest that the decrease in apoptosis observed in EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs was not due to altered VEEV replication kinetics.Despite being recognized as an emerging threat, relatively little is known about the virulence mechanisms of alphaviruses, largely due to a knowledge gap in the host-pathogen interactome. VEEV infection often results in fatal encephalitis and is known to inhibit both cellular transcription and translation in order to downregulate the innate immune response (1, 48) . In contrast, in the CNS VEEV has been shown to upregulate numerous genes in both the inflammatory response and apoptotic pathways (1, 48) . Specifically, numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including interleu-kin-1␤ (IL-1␤), IL-6, IL-12, glycogen synthase kinase 3␤, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣), have all been shown to play a role in VEEV pathogenesis (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) .',\n",
       "  'The use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, allows an in-depth and unbiased look into the virus-host transcriptome, thus enabling changes in the expression of specific mRNAs to be connected with phenotypic outcomes. To this end, identification of critical differentially expressed transcripts among clinically relevant infected cells will help lead to a greater understanding of viral pathogenesis and may prove beneficial for the identification of therapeutic targets.In this study, network analysis/RNA-Seq data and the results of protein expression studies revealed that VEEV infection resulted in activation of the PERK arm of the UPR pathway, including the activation of ATF4, CHOP, and eIF2␣ phosphorylation. Several alphaviruses have previously been reported to hijack key components of the UPR pathway in order to promote viral replication, as the reliance of enveloped viruses on the ER for the synthesis of viral envelope-associated glycoproteins and their transport to the plasma membrane often stresses the ER due to rapid viral protein production (54, 55) .',\n",
       "  'Modulation of the UPR is not unique to alphaviruses; rather, it is a shared trait of many positive-sense RNA viruses. Dengue virus has been shown to suppress PERK by inhibiting continued eIF2␣ phosphorylation in order to inhibit immediate apoptosis, increasing viral protein translation and extending the length of productive viral replication (34) . Studies with hepatitis E virus (HEV) have demonstrated that expression of HEV capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) activates the expression of CHOP and ATF4 (56) . In HEV, ORF2 was shown to stimulate CHOP through both ER stressors and amino acid response elements (AARE) through interaction with ATF4 (56) .The results shown here indicate that during VEEV infection, initiation of the UPR pathway and subsequent activation of EGR1 play a role in the outcome of virus-induced apoptosis.',\n",
       "  'During the initial detection of ER stress, PERK is able to identify misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER and phosphorylates eIF2␣ in order to initiate prosurvival pathways in the UPR through the general At 24 hpi caspase 3/7 activity was analyzed using the Caspase 3/7 Glo assay.

       "  'VEEV appears to induce the UPR and promote increased eIF2␣ phosphorylation, which results in the translational inhibition of most mRNAs, while UPR selectively increases the translation of ATF4. ATF4 is responsible for the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in apoptosis, redox processes, amino acid metabolism, and ER chaperone recruitment and is a well-known mediator of the PERK pathway and CHOP (33, 34) . CHOP activation facilitates the increased expression of cellular chaperones in order to counteract the buildup of misfolded proteins (57) . Failure to suppress protein misfolding in persistently stressed cells, such as during a viral infection, can then result in activation of the proapoptotic transcription factor CHOP, leading to suppression of the antiapoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). CHOP can also function as a prosurvival transcription factor by dephosphorylating eIF2␣ through activation of the DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34) in a self-regulating feedback look (33, 34) .',\n",
       "  'However, the data presented here support a model whereby VEEV infection leads CHOP to function in its proapoptotic role, as no change in GADD34 gene expression was detected by RNA-Seq analysis.While the UPR was induced following VEEV infection, robust activation was not observed until later time points after infection. This is somewhat surprising, as VEEV infection is expected to induce significant ER stress due to the massive production of viral proteins during the course of an acute robust infection. The structural proteins of VEEV are translated from the viral subgenomic RNA into polyproteins on the rough ER. The E1 and pE2 precur-sor glycoproteins are then assembled as heterodimers in the ER, undergoing conformational changes requiring numerous chaperones (1, 58) . It is possible that VEEV has developed mechanisms to subvert the induction of the UPR.',\n",
       "  'In order to counteract the UPR, the nonstructural proteins (nsPs) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been shown to inhibit expression of ATF4 and other known UPR target genes, including GRP78/BiP, GRP94, and CHOP (59) . Through nsP activity, CHIKV has developed a means of suppressing the UPR activity resulting from viral glycoprotein-induced ER stress, thus preventing immediate autophagy and apoptotic activation. The VEEV capsid is responsible for interfering with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and inhibiting rRNA and mRNA transcription and has been implicated in the regulation of type I IFN signaling and the antiviral response through the regulation of both viral RNA and protein production (1, 48, 60) . Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability of the VEEV capsid to inhibit cellular transcription and block nucleocytoplasmic trafficking results in delayed induction of the UPR.The results of a detailed network analysis based on existing data in the literature, coupled with the temporal gene expression profiles obtained from this study, point toward EGR1 being an important node in the novel link between VEEV activation of the type I interferon response and UPR.',\n",
       "  'EGR1 is known to form a DNA binding complex with C/EBPB, a critical dimerization partner of CHOP (61) . Previous studies have demonstrated that the nuclear localization of CHOP may act as an inducer of EGR1 and that CHOP may act as a transcriptional cofactor for regulation of C/EBPB-EGR1 target genes (61) . The results of the Western blot and microscopy analysis presented in this study support this model, as VEEV infection was found to increase both the overall levels and the nuclear distribution of CHOP along with those of EGR1. Previous studies demonstrated EGR1 mRNA induction by IFN-␥ in mouse fibroblasts and by TNF-␣, TNF-␤, IL-1, IFN-␣, IFN-␤, and IFN-␥ in human fibroblasts (31, 32) . EGR1, also known as Zif268 and NGF1-A, is a zinc finger protein and mammalian transcription factor. It has been implicated in cellular proliferation and differentiation, but it may also have proapoptotic functions, depending on the cell type and stimulus (62) .',\n",
       "  'Of particular interest, EGR1 directly controls proliferation when activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in mitogen-stimulated astrocytes (63) . Virus-induced changes in EGR1 expression have been observed in several in vitro systems. In HIV-1-infected astrocytes, EGR1 upregulation was found to be induced by Tat through transactivation of the EGR1 promoter, leading to cellular dysfunction and Tat-induced neurotoxicity (64) . Increased amounts of EGR1 mRNA have also been demonstrated to act in a region-specific manner, corresponding temporally with viral RNA production in the brain tissues of rats infected with either rabies virus or Borna disease virus (65) .In summary, the current study demonstrates a potential link between UPR activation and EGR1. EGR1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs demonstrated lower levels of susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death than wild-type MEFs, indicating that EGR1 modulates proapoptotic pathways following infection. Studies are under way to determine if alteration of the UPR through small molecule inhibitors or siRNA interference influences VEEV replication and/or cell death.',\n",
       "  ' To date the mechanisms underlying VEEV pathogenesis and subsequent neuronal degeneration have been only partially elucidated. Therefore, determining the role of EGR1 and UPR may play a significant role in the development of a novel therapeutic target resulting in decreased neuronal death and the subsequent neuronal sequelae that result from infection.'],\n",
       " ['Recently, two coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have emerged to cause unusually severe respiratory disease in humans. Currently, there is a lack of effective antiviral treatment options or vaccine available. Given the severity of these outbreaks, and the possibility of additional zoonotic coronaviruses emerging in the near future, the exploration of different treatment strategies is necessary. Disease resilience is the ability of a given host to tolerate an infection, and to return to a state of health. This review focuses on exploring various host resilience mechanisms that could be exploited for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses that cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.Text: The 21st century was heralded with the emergence of two novel coronaviruses (CoV) that have unusually high pathogenicity and mortality      .',\n",
       "  'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) was first identified in 2003     . While there was initially great concern about SARS-CoV, once no new cases emerged, funding and research decreased. However, a decade later Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also known as HCoV-EMC, emerged initially in Saudi Arabia [3, 10] . SARS-CoV infected about 8000 people, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 10% of those infected  . While MERS-CoV is not as widespread as SARS-CoV, it appears to have an even higher mortality rate, with 35-50% of diagnosed infections resulting in death [3,   . These deadly betacoronavirus viruses existed in animal reservoirs   9,   . Recently, other CoVs have been detected in animal populations raising the possibility that we will see a repeat of these types of outbreaks in the near future [11,      . Both these zoonotic viruses cause a much more severe disease than what is typically seen for CoVs, making them a global health concern.',\n",
       "  \"Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV result in severe lung pathology. Many infected patients have acute lung injury (ALI), a condition that is diagnosed based on the presence of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure without a cardiac cause. In some patients there is a progression to the more severe form of ALI, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)    .In order to survive a given infection, a successful host must not only be able to clear the pathogen, but tolerate damage caused by the pathogen itself and also by the host's immune response    . We refer to resilience as the ability of a host to tolerate the effects of pathogens and the immune response to pathogens. A resilient host is able to return to a state of health after responding to an infection [24,   . Most currently available treatment options for infectious diseases are antimicrobials, For reprint orders, please contact: reprints@futuremedicine.com REviEW Jamieson future science group and thus target the pathogen itself.\",\n",
       "  'Given the damage that pathogens can cause this focus on rapid pathogen clearance is understandable. However, an equally important medical intervention is to increase the ability of the host to tolerate the direct and indirect effects of the pathogen, and this is an area that is just beginning to be explored  . Damage to the lung epithelium by respiratory pathogens is a common cause of decreased resilience    . This review explores some of the probable host resilience pathways to viral infections, with a particular focus on the emerging coronaviruses. We will also examine factors that make some patients disease tolerant and other patients less tolerant to the viral infection. These factors can serve as a guide to new potential therapies for improved patient care.Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typified by a rapid progression to ARDS, however, there are some distinct differences in the infectivity and pathogenicity.',\n",
       "  'The two viruses have different receptors leading to different cellular tropism, and SARS-CoV is more ubiquitous in the cell type and species it can infect. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells, while MERS-CoV uses the ectopeptidase DPP4     . Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which causes primarily a severe respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV infection can also lead to kidney failure [37, 38] . SARS-CoV also spreads more rapidly between hosts, while MERS-CoV has been more easily contained, but it is unclear if this is due to the affected patient populations and regions   39 ]. Since MERS-CoV is a very recently discovered virus, [40, 41] more research has been done on SARS-CoV. However, given the similarities it is hoped that some of these findings can also be applied to MERS-CoV, and other potential emerging zoonotic coronaviruses.Both viral infections elicit a very strong inflammatory response, and are also able to circumvent the immune response.',\n",
       "  'There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response [1,     . The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response are common targets of many viruses, and coronaviruses are no exception. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles (DMVs), that prevents sensing of its genome [1, 46] . As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response, and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity  . These alterations of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way. In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis [39, 48] . This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral-induced pathology. There is also evidence that the delayed type I IFN response can lead to misregulation of the immune response that can cause immunopathology.',\n",
       "  'In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the type I IFN response is delayed  . The delay of this potent antiviral response leads to decreased viral clearance, at the same time there is an increase in inflammatory cells of the immune system that cause excessive immunopathology  . In this case, the delayed antiviral response not only causes immunopathology, it also fails to properly control the viral replication. While more research is needed, it appears that MERS has a similar effect on the innate immune response [5, 50] .The current treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are limited. So far there are no licensed vaccines for SAR-CoV or MERS-CoV, although several strategies have been tried in animal models [51, 52] . There are also no antiviral strategies that are clearly effective in controlled trials. During outbreaks several antiviral strategies were empirically tried, but these uncontrolled studies gave mixed results [5, 39] .',\n",
       "  'The main antivirals used were ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir [38, 53] . These were often used in combination with IFN therapy  . However, retrospective analysis of these data has not led to clear conclusions of the efficacy of these treatment options. Research in this area is still ongoing and it is hoped that we will soon have effective strategies to treat novel CoV [3,36,38,40,           .The lack of effective antivirals makes it necessary to examine other potential treatments for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even if there were effective strategies to decrease viral burden, for these viruses, the potential for new emerging zoonotic CoVs presents additional complications. Vaccines cannot be produced in time to stop the spread of an emerging virus. In addition, as was demonstrated during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, there is always a challenge during a crisis situation to know which Host resilience to emerging coronaviruses REviEW future science group www.futuremedicine.com antiviral will work on a given virus.',\n",
       "  'One method of addressing this is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that target conserved features of a given class of virus  . However, given the fast mutation rates of viruses there are several challenges to this strategy. Another method is to increase the ability of a given patient to tolerate the disease, i.e., target host resilience mechanisms. So far this has largely been in the form of supportive care, which relies on mechanical ventilation and oxygenation [29, 39, 66] .Since SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered relatively recently there is a lack of both patient and experimental data. However, many other viruses cause ALI and ARDS, including influenza A virus (IAV). By looking at data from other high pathology viruses we can extrapolate various pathways that could be targeted during infection with these emerging CoVs. This can add to our understanding of disease resilience mechanisms that we have learned from direct studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.',\n",
       "  'Increased understanding of host resilience mechanisms can lead to future host-based therapies that could increase patient survival  .One common theme that emerges in many respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that much of the pathology is due to an excessive inflammatory response. A study from Josset et al. examines the cell host response to both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and discovered that MERS-CoV dysregulates the host transcriptome to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV  . It demonstrates that glucocorticoids may be a potential way of altering the changes in the host transcriptome at late time points after infection. If host gene responses are maintained this may increase disease resilience. Given the severe disease that manifested during the SARS-CoV outbreak, many different treatment options were empirically tried on human patients. One immunomodulatory treatment that was tried during the SARS-CoV outbreak was systemic corticosteroids.',\n",
       "  'This was tried with and without the use of type I IFNs and other therapies that could directly target the virus  . Retrospective analysis revealed that, when given at the correct time and to the appropriate patients, corticosteroid use could decrease mortality and also length of hospital stays  . In addition, there is some evidence that simultaneous treatment with IFNs could increase the potential benefits  . Although these treatments are not without complications, and there has been a lack of a randomized controlled trial [5, 39] .Corticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and have many physiological effects [5, 39] . Several recent studies have suggested that other compounds could be useful in increasing host resilience to viral lung infections. A recent paper demonstrates that topoisomerase I can protect against inflammation-induced death from a variety of viral infections including IAV  . Blockade of C5a complement signaling has also been suggested as a possible option in decreasing inflammation during IAV infection  .',\n",
       "  'Other immunomodulators include celecoxib, mesalazine and eritoran [72, 73] . Another class of drugs that have been suggested are statins. They act to stabilize the activation of aspects of the innate immune response and prevent excessive inflammation  . However, decreasing immunopathology by immunomodulation is problematic because it can lead to increased pathogen burden, and thus increase virus-induced pathology [75, 76] . Another potential treatment option is increasing tissue repair pathways to increase host resilience to disease. This has been shown by bioinformatics  , as well as in several animal models [30-31,78-79]. These therapies have been shown in cell culture model systems or animal models to be effective, but have not been demonstrated in human patients. The correct timing of the treatments is essential. Early intervention has been shown to be the most effective in some cases, but other therapies work better when given slightly later during the course of the infection.',\n",
       "  'As the onset of symptoms varies slightly from patient to patient the need for precise timing will be a challenge.Examination of potential treatment options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should include consideration of host resilience  . In addition to the viral effects, and the pathology caused by the immune response, there are various comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that lead to adverse outcomes. Interestingly, these additional risk factors that lead to a more severe disease are different between the two viruses. It is unclear if these differences are due to distinct populations affected by the viruses, because of properties of the virus themselves, or both. Understanding these factors could be a key to increasing host resilience to the infections. MERS-CoV patients had increased morbidity and mortality if they were obese, immunocompromised, diabetic or had cardiac disease [4, 12] .REviEW Jamieson future science group Risk factors for SARS-CoV patients included an older age and male  .',\n",
       "  'Immune factors that increased mortality for SARS-CoV were a higher neutrophil count and low T-cell counts [5, 39, 77] . One factor that increased disease for patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was infection with other viruses or bacteria [5, 39] . This is similar to what is seen with many other respiratory infections. A recent study looking at malaria infections in animal models and human patients demonstrated that resilient hosts can be predicted  . Clinical studies have started to correlate specific biomarkers with disease outcomes in ARDS patients  . By understanding risk factors for disease severity we can perhaps predict if a host may be nonresilient and tailor the treatment options appropriately.A clear advantage of targeting host resilience pathways is that these therapies can be used to treat a variety of different infections. In addition, there is no need to develop a vaccine or understand the antiviral susceptibility of a new virus.',\n",
       "  'Toward this end, understanding why some patients or patient populations have increased susceptibility is of paramount importance. In addition, a need for good model systems to study responses to these new emerging coronaviruses is essential.

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia.',\n",

Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.Text: Since mid-December 2019 and as of early February 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) has infected over 25,000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths (a case-fatality rate of about 2%). More than 90% of the cases and deaths were in China  .',\n",
       "  'Based on the initial reported surge of cases in Wuhan, the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market  . Most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. Most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome  .The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a betacoronavirus, forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily  . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively [5, 6] .

Among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with 2019-nCoV  ( Table 1 ). The period and type of specimen collected for RT-PCR play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. It was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. It has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms.Apart from the commonly used RT-PCR in diagnosing MERS-CoV, four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) and a one-step rRT-PCR assay based on specific TaqMan probes.',\n",
       "  'RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity as real time RT-PCR. It is also highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV. It is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid, simple and convenient. Likewise, RT-iiPCR and a one-step rRT-PCR assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for MER-CoV. Lastly, one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real RT-PCR kits, with high accuracy. Although real time RT-PCR is a primary method for diagnosing MERS-CoV, high levels of PCR inhibition may hinder PCR sensitivity (Table 1) .There are eleven studies that focus on SARS-CoV diagnostic testing (Table 1) . These papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis. Comparison between the molecular test (i.e RT-PCR) and serological test (i.e., ELISA) showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity. Hence, enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis.',\n",

Six of these are only for research purposes. Only one kit from Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis. Most of the kits are for RT-PCR.

The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60.',\n",
       "  'Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60. Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks. Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics  .',\n",

Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong      .

One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature  . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses.

The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures.',\n",

Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] .Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles.The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase.',\n",
       "  'The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. The limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples. All patients recovered.Significantly shorted time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement in treatment (5.10 ± 2.83 days) compared to control group (7.62 ± 2.27 days) (p < 0.05) No significant difference in blood routine improvement, pulmonary chest shadow in chest film improvement and corticosteroid usgae between the 2 groups. However, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone.',\n",
       "  'Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. Although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild MERS and SARS cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases.The existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), (b) real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and (d) real-time RT-LAMP  .',\n",

Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus  . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, as highlighted in WHO's interim guidance on nCoV laboratory testing of suspected cases. These include protocols from other countries such as Thailand, Japan and China  .The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like. Upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment.\",\n",

All assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses  .The Hong Kong University used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus Sarbecovirus (consisting of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronavirus). Viral RNA extracted from SARS-CoV can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that SARS has been eradicated. It is proposed that the N gene RT-PCR can be used as a screening assay while the Orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test. However, this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control SARS-CoV RNA.',\n",

However, the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described. There are some limitations for the assay. Analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation. False negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation or handling. Also, RNA viruses may show substantial genetic variability. This could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results  .',\n",

Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. There would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset  . Furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load. Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible  .Vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest, especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes.',\n",
       "  \"In the context of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak, vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection. This decreases the effective R0 value of the disease. Nonetheless, there are social, clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes, including (a) the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine, (b) the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination, (c) the potential difference and/or low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials' populations and (d) the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population (including the cost and availability of the vaccine).Vaccines against the 2019-nCoV are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing).\",\n",

The vaccine candidates will be developed by the DNA, recombinant and mRNA vaccine platforms from these organizations  .Based on the most recent MERS-CoV outbreak, there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage. The vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccine, inactivated whole-virus (IWV) vaccine and live attenuated vaccine. The latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by Yong et al. (2019) in August 2019  .

Both Phase I clinical trials reported positive results, but only one has announced plans to proceed to Phase 2 trial  .Due to the close genetic relatedness of SARS-CoV (79%) with 2019-nCoV  , there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe SARS-CoV vaccine while awaiting the 2019-nCoV vaccine. However, this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementation.Apart from the timely diagnosis of cases, the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered. ACE2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-nCoV to infect humans as SARS-CoV  . Hence, clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases.',\n",

Coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), which result in frequent mutations and recombination events. This results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk  . Since ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-nCoV, similarly to SAR-CoV.However, in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease [116, 117] .',\n",

No coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring SARS-CoV inhibitors. The bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase, with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle. Stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential. Effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections. Clinical trials have commenced in China to identify effective treatments for 2019-nCoV based on the treatment evidence from SARS and MERS. There is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence; any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical study/trial.',\n",

Interferon β has consistently been shown to be the most active, followed by interferon α. The use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (synthetic interferon α) appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls. Interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [116, 117] . Interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in China for 2019-nCoV. This drug treatment appears to be the most advanced. Timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness.',\n",
       "  'A combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection. Ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages. Hence, ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed. This was the most common agent reported in the available literature. Its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies, retrospective case series, retrospective cohort study, a prospective observational study, a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants  . Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of SARS-CoV. Its efficacy was documented in several studies, causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone. Combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infection and death, amongst other favorable outcomes.',\n",

Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, GS-5734) nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support GS-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses (CoVs), including highly pathogenic CoVs and potentially emergent BatCoVs. The use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment.Improved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology. A significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 0.25 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed  . Studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes, allocation of treatment based on the physician's discretion, and the availability of plasma.\",\n",
       "  'Factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results. Associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay, viral antibody levels, and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature. Convalescent plasma, while promising, is likely not yet feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability. Monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing. SARS-CoV enters host cells through the binding of their spike (S) protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L  . Human monoclonal antibodies to the S protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following MERS-CoV infection  . Such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively. While such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines, there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodies.Other therapeutic agents have also been reported.',\n",

Chloroquine is also immunomodulatory, capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6)  . It is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ACE2 glycosylation and endosomal pH. Its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment. The efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays. In both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays, niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. Reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent. Niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells, nor does it function as a protease inhibitor.',\n",

Glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses. While preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide (which inhibits virus replication) through induction of nitrous oxide synthase, the mechanism of Glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV remains unclear. The compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin  . Inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin  , extracted from another herb used in the treatment of SARS in China and Hong Kong. Findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies     .Due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-nCoV, there will be potential limitations to the systematic review.

Inovirus display studies have shown that the architecture of inoviruses makes all coat proteins of the inoviral particle accessible to the outside. This particular feature of IAVs allows foreign antigenic peptides to be displayed on the outer surface of the virion fused to its coat proteins and for more than two decades has been exploited in many applications including antibody or peptide display libraries, drug design, and vaccine development against infectious and non-infectious diseases. As vaccine carriers, IAVs have been shown to elicit both a cellular and humoral response against various pathogens through the display of antibody epitopes on their coat proteins. Despite their high immunogenicity, the goal of developing an effective vaccine against HIV-1 has not yet materialized.',\n",
       "  'One possible limitation of previous efforts was the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which exhibited autoreactivity properties. In the past five years, however, new, more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that do not exhibit autoreactivity properties have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, suggesting that vaccination strategies aimed at producing such broadly neutralizing antibodies may confer protection against infection. The utilization of these new, broadly neutralizing antibodies in combination with the architectural traits of IAVs have driven the current developments in the design of an inovirus-based vaccine against HIV-1. This article reviews the applications of IAVs in vaccine development, with particular emphasis on the design of inoviral-based vaccines against HIV-1.Text: Filamentous bacterial viruses are a group of thread-like viruses containing single-stranded DNA genomes. Collectively, they constitute the genus Inovirus in the family Inoviridae, the terms deriving from the Greek word Ίνα for filament    , and they are commonly called filamentous bacteriophages.',\n",
       "  \"There are over 50 different known individual species of filamentous viruses; the majority of them capable of infecting Gram-negative bacteria. The complex interaction between filamentous phages and their bacterial hosts is specified by receptor organelles that are usually encoded by transmissible plasmids [1, 4] . One of the most intriguing features of inoviruses is that they are assembled at the host membrane, where the major capsid protein subunits replace the single-stranded DNA binding protein, and progeny virions are continuously extruded into the medium without killing the infected cell, giving rise to titers of up to 10 13 virions per milliliter of liquid culture [5, 6] . The high virus production is associated only with a mild retardation of the host's growth, which gives rise to the formation of opaque plaques on bacterial lawns. In this sense, filamentous viruses bear a resemblance to symbiotic non-pathogenic animal viruses rather than phages, the term coming from the Greek word φάγος for destroyer.\",\n",
       "  \"Inovirus virions are flexible and slender cylindrical filaments [2, 3] less than 10 nm in diameter and in the order of 1000 nm in length (see details in Figure 1 ). Each virion has several thousand identical major capsid or coat protein subunits packaging a circular single-stranded DNA molecule. Each virion also has a few specific minor proteins at each end, those at one end (proximal end) for attachment during infection, and those at the other end (distal end) for nucleation and initiation of the assembly process at the host's membrane.The number of species of inovirus isolated and characterized in different parts of the world is rather large  . Among E. coli inoviruses, the best-studied and most-exploited is Ff, a group of closely related viruses (fd, f1 and M13) (for review see [4, 6] ) that infect male (F + ) strains of E. coli.\",\n",
       "  'All Ff have almost identical DNA and protein sequences, gene organization, and most other structural parameters    . Fd, M13 and f1 differ in their genomes at only about 100 positions out of 6408 nucleotides for f1 and fd or 6407 nucleotides for M13. The genetics and life cycle of three viruses f1, fd and M13 have been studied extensively and we know a great deal about them. The Ff genome contains ten tightly arranged genes and a non-coding intergenic region, which contains the packaging signal    , the (+) and (−) origins of DNA replication, and the major rho-dependent transcriptional terminator (for recent review see  ). Five of the ten viral genes encode proteins found in the virion (g3, g6, g8, g7 and g9). Genes 3 and 6 are found on the proximal end of the virion and are essential for infectivity and stabilization, whereas, gene 7 and gene 9 proteins, gp7 and gp9, respectively, are located at the distal end of the virion and are responsible for the initiation assembly    .',\n",
       "  'In the end-to-end model illustrated in Figure 1 , both the proximal (gp7 and gp9) and distal (gp3 and gp6) minor coat protein subunits maintain the fivefold axial symmetry of the major coat protein gp8 subunits along the virion.The life cycle of Ff filamentous viruses starts with the adsorption of the virus to the tip of the F + specific pilus of E. coli. Attachment takes place by means of an adsorption structure composed of five copies of gp3, located at the proximal end of the virion (see Figure 1 ), mainly through sequential binding of the gp3 N2 domain with the tip of the F pilus and the N1 domain with the periplasmic domain III of TolA (for recent review see reference 4). After adsorption, the virus is drawn to the surface of the cell where the major coat protein gp8 subunits become associated with the inner membrane of the cell    and the circular single-stranded DNA (cssDNA) is released into the cytoplasm.',\n",
       "  'Inside the cytoplasm, the cssDNA is converted into a parental double-stranded replicative form (RF). Ff inoviruses replicate their genome by a rolling-circle mechanism. Consecutive transcription from the RF DNA, and translation as well an asymmetric single strand DNA synthesis lead to an intracellular pool of viral precursor complexes, which contain viral single-stranded DNA molecules bound with gp5 protein subunits, except a small hairpin loop that serves as the packaging signal for virion assembly    . The major coat protein gp8 subunits are synthesized with a signal peptide sequence that facilitates their transport to and insertion into the bacterial membrane, where they are cleaved by signal peptidase. After cleavage, the mature coat protein is left spanning the membrane with its C terminus in the cytoplasm and the N terminus outside the cytoplasm in the periplasm    . The assembly of filamentous viruses takes place at the membrane where the gp5 subunits are replaced by gp8 subunits.',\n",
       "  'The first step of the assembly sequence is the binding of the packaging signal, a site of about 30 nucleotides that forms a hairpin loop, with presumably five subunits of each of the minor coat proteins gp7 and gp9      . Virus assembly proceeds as single-stranded DNA passes through the membrane and more mature coat protein gp8 subunits are added until the entire DNA molecule is packaged. At the distal end of the virion, five copies of each of gp6 and gp3 are added and the complete virion is released into the medium [23, 27] . The assembly of inoviruses on the bacterial inner membrane is a harmonized sequential process that involves a variety of interactions between viral-encoded proteins (gp1, gp4 and gp11) and host-encoded proteins, without killing the host bacterium (reviewed by  ).The structure of the Ff virus has been extensively studied by a number of laboratories in the last five decades.',\n",
       "  'However, despite all of the efforts, the structure has not been completely determined and some critical questions remain unanswered. The major difficulty is that these viruses cannot be crystallized. They can be oriented in fibers suitable for X-ray fiber diffraction studies, but these are not crystals. Interpretations of the fiber diffraction patterns together with a number of physicochemical measurements, have shown that the major coat protein gp8 subunits have a five-start helical symmetry (5-fold rotation axis) and are referred to as Class I    strictly based on the fundamental symmetry of the protein subunits helices as determined by fiber diffraction (reviewed by  ). On the other hand, the structure of the packaged ssDNA molecule in the virion, including its helical symmetry and the interactions with the protein sheath, is one of the least understood aspects. The structure of the DNA inside these viruses cannot be determined by conventional X-ray fiber diffraction techniques, partly because of the low DNA content in the virions.',\n",

The distal end of the virion (right) consists of five copies of each minor coat proteins gp7 and gp9, modeled following the helical parameters of gp8 according to a previously published model  .The easy genetic manipulation of inoviruses and the possibility of inserting random oligonucleotides into their genome set the foundation for inovirus display (phage display) technology [37, 38] . Expression of these genetically modified inoviruses results in the presentation of oligopeptides as fusion proteins on the surface of the virion and are herein termed IAVs for inovirus-associated vectors. IAVs can be modified to express an oligopeptide on either all or on some copies of a particular capsid protein.',\n",
       "  'One possibility is to insert an oligonucleotide sequence of interest in the viral genome to create a fusion with capsid protein gp3, gp7, gp8 or gp9, so that the oligopeptide is displayed on every copy of the capsid protein. Alternatively, a phagemid vector can be used, which carries an extra copy of a capsid protein to which the oligonucleotide is fused. Coinfection of bacterial hosts with the phagemid vector and a replication deficient helper phage, that carries the wild type capsid protein, would result in mosaic inovirus particles. That is, they will contain copies of both the wild type coat protein and the recombinant protein that contains the oligopeptide of interest  . Non-mosaic and mosaic IAVs that display a peptide on gp3 or gp8 have been recently reviewed  while IAVs that display a peptide on gp7 or gp9 have been reviewed elsewhere    .',\n",
       "  'In contrast to the other four-capsid proteins, gp6 capsid protein has only been utilized for the production of mosaic virions    . Figure 2 illustrates the display of an antigen on each of the five capsid proteins of an IAV as indicated in published literature. It also introduces a new terminology to denote the gene to which the oligopeptides are fused to and whether the virion is a mosaic. To display many copies of an oligopeptide on an IAV, the ideal capsid protein to utilize is gp8. The resulting non-mosaic IAV can display a peptide on each of the approximately 2700 copies of gp8 on its capsid surface. The tradeoff, however, is a significant limitation in the size of the peptide: only peptides up to 6 amino acids may be displayed without distorting the assembly of the virus (see Figures 2 and 3 ).',\n",
       "  'This size restriction of the displayed peptide may be overcome by generating a mosaic IAV that displays the foreign peptide in only a minority of gp8 on the viral surface  . With regards to the display of peptides on gp3, it is possible through mosaic IAVs to present even a whole protein on the viral surface  . Although in such a case the protein is expected to be present in up to five copies per virion, studies show that virions carry none, or just one copy of the protein on their surface  .Random Peptide Libraries (RPL) is one common application of IAVs, where random oligopeptides are displayed on different clones of an inovirus particle. The vast diversity of an RPL depends on the size of the oligopeptide where the complexity of an RPL increases exponentially as the size of the oligopeptide increases.',\n",
       "  'RPLs can subsequently be used in many applications including the identification of peptide ligands by receptors, the mapping of substrate sites for enzymes, and the creation of antibody peptide libraries. These applications are reviewed elsewhere [38, 46, 47] . Inovirus display technology has also been used for epitope mapping and vaccine design purposes. RPLs can be used to characterize the epitope of an antibody of interest through biopanning with a monoclonal antibody of interest, which can result in the isolation of mimotopes; these are oligopeptides that mimic the native antibody epitope. The selected recombinant inoviruses that carry mimotopes can then be isolated in order to determine the DNA and amino acid sequence of the displayed oligopeptides. DNA sequencing of such inserts as well as structure prediction analysis can potentially identify the previously unknown target of an antibody. Besides antibody characterization, inoculation of recombinant inoviruses isolated through this approach can potentially be used as vaccine carriers.',\n",
       "  'For example, if a neutralizing antibody against a pathogen is used to screen an RPL, the selected peptides (fused to inoviruses) would mimic the original antibody epitope. Vaccination of animals with these inoviruses could ultimately induce the production of similar antibodies by the vaccinated individual, offering protection from infection against the pathogen. Inovirus display technology has been successfully applied in the development of vaccines against various pathogens (Tables 1 and 2 ). The potential for inovirus display technology to facilitate the mapping of antibody epitopes is of great importance, especially in the case of HIV-1. Epitopes of broadly neutralizing monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibodies could be rare, vulnerable spots on the surface of a frequently mutating virus such as HIV-1 and therefore, their identification and further study could lead to new drug therapies or vaccine targets.',\n",

The relative virion surface area (about 1400 Å 2 ) associated with each gp8 subunit is marked in yellow.

The displayed antigens, represented by red spheres, are arranged on the surface of the Ff.g8 inovirus-associated vector according to helical symmetry of the virion outer architecture (bottom). IAVs are effective vaccine carriers and, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 , they have been used successfully in numerous vaccine development studies.',\n",
       "  'They have been utilized in the development of vaccines against a wide variety of viral, protozoan and worm parasites and also against non-infectious diseases like Alzheimer and various types of cancer. All these attempts can be divided in two main sub-categories. The first sub-category, inovirus display technology was used to screen RPLs with monoclonal antibodies and then to select the immunogenic peptides of interest. The selected peptide was used as a vaccine in its soluble form or in conjugation with carrier proteins [55,66,70,81-84, 86-88,90-92,98] . In the second sub-category, similar to the first sub-category, inovirus display technology has been used for epitope mapping and isolation, but in this case, inoviruses were also used as the vaccine carriers for the immunogenic peptides        56, 57,                     . In contrast to IAVs, soluble peptides have the disadvantage of being less stable than the same peptides fused to inoviral particles.',\n",
       "  'Soluble peptides have a flexible 3D structure and thus, do not always retain the 3D structure of the desirable epitope. As a result, soluble peptides, unlike inovirus-bound peptides, are less capable of inducing the production of the desirable antibodies  . Additionally, the inoviral vectors displaying peptides are highly immunogenic. Their high immunogenicity is reinforced by the ability of inoviruses to display multiple copies of peptides on their surface. Additionally, inoviruses are known for their structural simplicity, which allows the immune system to focus selectively on the displayed peptides and not on the viral carrier  . Furthermore, since inoviruses can replicate in E. coli cultures, the cost of vaccine production is low. In summary, IAVs can be used as efficient and cost effective vaccine carriers.A large number of research studies have focused on the application of inovirus-based vaccines against infectious diseases.',\n",
       "  'A common approach in many of these efforts was to vaccinate animals with inoviruses and to then challenge them with specific pathogens, in order to assess the level of protection against the pathogens. Three of these studies focused on immunization against viral parasites. In 1997, Bastien et al. fused a 15-mer linear epitope of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) glycoprotein G on inovirus gp3 and used the recombinant inovirus to vaccinate mice  . This resulted in a specific humoral response, with the vaccinated animals having complete protection from challenge with the RSV virus  . In 2000, Grabowska et al. used monoclonal antibodies against Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein G2 to screen 15-mer RPLs  . The selected recombinant inoviruses were used to vaccinate mice, resulting in a specific humoral response. A high survival rate of vaccinated mice after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus was observed, and the level of protection was proportional to the dose of the inoviral vaccine  .',\n",
       "  'Additionally, in 2000, Yu et al. used monoclonal antibodies against the surface glycoprotein of Neurotropic Murine Coronavirus to screen various RPLs  . A selected clone displaying a 13-mer peptide induced a humoral immune response but no cellular response in mice. Even so, after lethal virus challenge, three out of six mice survived.  . Besides viral infections, inoviral vaccine research has also been applied for systemic candidiasis, a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. In two separate studies, a specific six amino acid peptide epitope of the fungal heat shock protein 90 was displayed as a fusion with the inoviral coat protein gp8 [73, 74] . After infection with the parasite, mice immunized with the recombinant inoviruses had fewer colony forming units of Candida albicans in the kidney and a longer lifespan  .',\n",
       "  'The use of inovirus as a vaccine carrier was particularly successful against Taenia solium, a parasitic worm that uses pigs as intermediate hosts and causes neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease of the central nervous system, in humans  . In 2004, Manoutsarian et al. fused four antigenic peptides (GK1, KETc1, KETc7, KETc12) to inoviruses and the cocktail of recombinant inoviruses was used to vaccinate pigs; as a result, a specific cellular response was induced. Vaccination of pigs protected them against challenge with the pathogen: 1/3 of pigs were totally protected and 2/3 had reduced number of cysticerci  . Based on these results, large-scale vaccination of 1047 rural pigs in 16 villages of central Mexico was conducted in 2008. The immunization was successful since the vaccine conferred significant protection against the parasite. Furthermore, this inovirus-based vaccine was more economical compared with to another vaccine made of synthetic peptides.',\n",
       "  'The study was particularly important, not only due to the large scale vaccination attempt with inoviruses, but also due to its effectiveness in significantly reducing the number of cysticerci in the vaccinated animals  . Efforts were also made to develop vaccines against the worm Schistosoma japonicum. In 2004, Tang et al. screened a 12-mer RPL with polyclonal serum from infected mice  . The selected recombinant inoviruses induced a specific humoral response, which conferred partial protection from parasite challenge in the vaccinated mice  . Following this study, in 2006, Wang et al. used the monoclonal antibody SSj14, which targets the parasite to screen a 12-mer RPL  . The recombinant inoviruses induced both humoral and cellular responses that significantly protected the vaccinated mice against the worm infection  . Additionally, in 2006, Wu et al. used polyclonal serum from infected rabbits to screen a 12-mer RPL  .',\n",

In 2008, Villa-Mancera et al., produced a vaccine against Fasciola hepatica, by screening a previously constructed 12-mer inovirus RLP with an anti-cathepsin L monoclonal antibody  . Although immunization of sheep with the selected recombinant inoviruses induced a weak, specific humoral response after challenge with the parasite, the vaccinated animals had a remarkable reduction in worm burden compared to controls  . An inovirus-based vaccine has been constructed against the parasitic worm Trichinella spiralis. In this case, Gu et al. used a monoclonal antibody against rTs87 antigen to screen a 12-mer RPL  . As a result, a humoral response was induced and the vaccinated mice gained partial protection after challenge against the parasite  .',\n",

In 2005, Fang et al. displayed an epitope of the Melanoma Antigen A1 (MAGE A1) in the surface of inovirus fused on gp8  . This resulted in an induction of cellular immune response against the melanoma tumor and in the significant inhibition of tumor growth in the vaccinated mice. In addition, there was an important increase in the survival rate of vaccinated animals  . Similar results were obtained in 2002 by Wu et al.',\n",

An epitope of the P1A tumor antigen was fused to the inoviral surface and the vaccinated mice gained significant protection against tumor growth. Moreover, there was a significant increase in survival rate due to an anti-tumor cellular response that was induced  . Some important efforts have also been made for the design of an inovirus-based vaccine against Alzheimer's disease. The main target of these vaccines was the induction of antibodies against β-amyloid plaques. In these studies, the antigenic epitope that was displayed in the inoviral surface was the epitope EGFR, which consists of the four amino acids E, G, F and R and it is part of the β-amyloid peptide. In mice immunized with recombinant inoviruses, the researchers observed a reduction in β-amyloid plaque burden and a specific humoral response     .\",\n",
       "  'Collectively, these studies show that it is possible to protect vaccinated animals against disease progression, thus alluding to the promising use of such vaccines against non-infectious diseases in humans.In summary, the utilization of inoviral vectors for vaccine development against infectious and non-infectious non-HIV-1 diseases has produced significant and promising results. First, in the majority of cases, the vaccine was successful since it induced specific humoral or cellular response, or both. Furthermore, in many cases, there was an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine after challenge against the pathogen in vaccinated animals. In all cases, the vaccine could provide partial, significant or even complete protection against the pathogen. This established the effectiveness of the use of inoviruses as vaccine vectors.Our knowledge of HIV-1 neutralization epitopes initiated from the isolation of several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (2F5, 4E10, b12 and 2G12) that were described between 1993 and 1994    .',\n",

Monoclonal antibody 2G12 targets the surface glycans on the outer domain of gp120 that is distinct from the four major epitope target sites described above [102, 104, 129] .The inovirus display technology has also been applied in vaccination strategies against HIV-1  . However, unlike the successful development of vaccines against non-HIV-1 parasites, these efforts failed.',\n",

The first study for the construction of a vaccine against HIV-1 using inovirus display technology was performed in 1993 by Keller et al., using the 447-52D monoclonal antibody to screen a 15-mer RPL  . Vaccination of selected recombinant inoviruses in rabbits resulted in the induction of type-specific neutralizing antibodies  . A few years later, in 2001, Zwick et al. used b12 monoclonal antibody to screen a variety of linear and constrained RPLs  . However, the vaccination in mice and rabbits with the selected recombinant inoviruses did not result in the production of b12-like antibodies at detectable levels  . The same antibody was used in 2005 by Dorgham et al.',\n",

In another study in 2007, Wilkinson et al. screened a 9-mer and a constrained 10-mer library with antibody 5145A  . This was the only case in which the selected mimotopes were fused in to small heat shock protein (HSP) of the archeaon Methanococcus jannaschii as a carrier protein. Following vaccination of HSP-mimotopes in rabbits, anti-gp120 antibodies without neutralizing potency were produced  . The 2G12 antibody was used for the first time in 2008 by Menendez et al. for the screening of a variety of linear and constrained RPLs  . Nevertheless, vaccination of selected inoviruses in rabbits induced the production of antibodies that could not bind to gp120  .',\n",
       "  'More recently, in 2011, Rodriguez et al. used the 2F5 antibody to screen a 12-mer and a constrained 7-mer RPL  . Vaccination in mice and rabbits led to the production of non-neutralizing antibodies  . In most of these studies, the use of inoviral vectors resulted in the induction of a specific humoral response. However, the sera of the vaccinated animals did not have broadly neutralizing ability.Besides monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal sera from HIV-1-infected patients were also used for the screening RPLs (Table 1) [51, 53,    63] . This approach carries a degree of uncertainty, since it is based on the premise that the polyclonal sera will contain at least one broadly neutralizing monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibody, meaning that a new neutralizing epitope against it can be isolated from the RPL.',\n",
       "  'It is suggested that long-term non-progressors (HIV-1-infected patients who remain asymptomatic for a long time) are more likely to produce neutralizing antibodies in comparison to AIDS patients, and it is suggested that these neutralizing antibodies in the serum of long-term non-progressors may contribute to the control of viral load    . However, this hypothesis has been questioned  . Polyclonal serum for the screening of RPLs was used for the first time in 1999 by Scala et al., who screened both linear and constrained 9-mer RPLs  . After that, vaccination of selected inoviruses in mice led to the production of neutralizing antibodies. A few years later, in 2007, Rodriguez et al. used polyclonal serum to screen a 7-mer, a 12-mer and a constrained 7-mer RPL  .

In this study, vaccination in mice was performed using the prime-boost strategy: DNA vaccine as prime (encoding gp160) and a cocktail of recombinant inoviruses as boost. The result was the induction of neutralizing antibodies  . In 2013, Gazarian et al. screened a linear 12-mer and constrained 7-mer RPLs using sera from HIV-infected individuals  .

Furthermore, the vaccinated macaques were not protected from infection, but four out of five animals were able to control the viral load after challenge against the pathogenic SHIV89.6PD virus. This was a very important result, which underlines the potential of the method. Additionally, no specific CTL response was detected, implying that the control of viral load was an exclusive result of humoral response  .Since the first attempt to induce the production of anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies using inovirus-based vaccines, all efforts to date have not led to the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals.',\n",
       "  'This failure could be to a certain extent explained by the usage of the \"old generation\" monoclonal antibodies (2F5, 2G12 and b12) which were shown to demonstrate autoreactivity properties in vitro studies      . In 2010, Verkoczy et al. demonstarted in an in vivo study that Pre-B cells expressing 2F5-like antibodies were unable to maturate in mice, suggesting a triggering of immunological tolerance due to the autoreactive properties of the 2F5-like antibody  . Collectively, these studies implied that the screening RPLs using 2F5, 2G12 and b12 could result in inoviral-based vaccines that could trigger immunological tolerance in vaccinated animals. It is important to note, however, that the lack of autoreactivity properties for several of the \"next generation\" broadly neutralizing antibodies (10e8, PG9, PG16, VRC01-03, VRC-PG04, VRC-PG04b, and VRC-CH30-34) could solve the autoreactivity problems encountered by 2F5, 2G12, and b12.Despite the fact that the recent isolation of new broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 has focused the attention of HIV-1 vaccine development on the induction of a humoral anti-HIV-1 response, recent results underline the importance of a cellular anti-HIV-1 response as well [141, 142] .',\n",
       "  'The experimental results concerning inovirus-based vaccines in non-HIV-1 diseases prove that inoviruses can also induce a strong specific cellular response (Tables 1 and 2); this property makes them great candidates as vectors for HIV-1 vaccine design. The ability of inoviruses to induce a cellular immune response was first demonstrated in 2000 by DeBerardinis et al.  . In this work, recombinant inoviruses carrying the RT2 epitope and the pep23 epitope of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in gp8 could induce specific cellular responses in human cell lines in vitro and in mice in vivo against the RT2 peptide. It is interesting that without the pep23 epitope, the cellular response was undetectable. This indicates that the pep23 is a CTL epitope that is necessary for cellular response, possibly because it enables internalization of the recombinant inovirus into the APCs  . Therefore, a question arises of whether an epitope fused to the surface of the inovirus can induce a cellular or a humoral response or both.',\n",
       "  'It is suggested that the type of immune response caused by an epitope fused on the surface of the inovirus is dependent on the length and sequence of the peptide  . In 2003, Gaubin et al. demonstrated that FITC-labeled fd virions can be internalized in human EBV-B cell lines and the fd virions are successively degraded and targeted both to MHC class I and class II antigen-processing pathways  . This was confirmed after endocellular localization of the labeled virions with confocal microscopy. This experiment showed that the inoviruses could be internalized in APCs even without carrying a CTL epitope, but in very low rate. For in vivo experiments however, it is possible that the requirement of a CTL epitope is critical for the induction of a cellular response  . In 2011, Sartorius et al.',\n",
       "  'showed that a hybrid fd virion with the anti-DEC-205 scFv antibody fragment fused on gp3 and the OVA257-264 antigenic epitope fused on gp8 can be internalized in human dendritic cells through a specific interaction between the anti-DEC205 scFv and the DEC-205 receptor  . In addition, inoculation of mice with the hybrid virions induced a specific cellular response against the OVA257-264 epitope  . This important characteristic of inoviral vectors to induce a cellular response was reported in only two studies aimed at developing a HIV-1 inoviral vaccine, possibly due to the complexity of detecting a cellular response and also because it is a labor intensive and time-consuming process. In 2001, Chen et al. attempted to detect a cellular response, but such a response was not induced in that experiment  . A more recent research study related to HIV-1, which clearly demonstrates the ability of inoviruses to induce strong cellular response, was performed in 2009 by Pedroza-Roldan et al.  .',\n",
       "  'In this effort, an immunodominant CTL epitope of the V3 loop of gp120 (residues 311-320) was expressed as fusion to gp8 of an M13 inovirus. A random peptide library was created by inserting mutations in certain positions of this epitope. A cocktail of inoviruses carrying the V3 loop epitope or variations of this epitope were used for the vaccination of mice and, as a result, a CTL response was induced. The most important result of this study was that the immunization induced long-lasting memory T-cell responses, which were detected seven months after a single immunization  . The same vaccination also induced a strong humoral response, since the sera of vaccinated mice could neutralize five out of ten pseudoviruses from a panel  .',\n",
       "  'All the above experiments clearly show that the inoviruses are capable of inducing a specific cellular immune response: the ability of the inoviral vectors to induce both arms of adaptive immunity is unique and it could prove to be valuable in the development of a successful HIV-1 vaccine.In the general field of HIV-1 vaccine design, all studies for the production of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies through vaccination with either soluble peptides or viral vectors have been unsuccessful. For this reason, some efforts have been directed to the induction of cellular immune response [146, 147] . In recent years, in HIV-1 vaccine phase I and phase II clinical trials, adenoviral vectors have been used in order induce a cellular immune response in HIV-1 vaccinated individuals     . However, there are concerns about the safety of these viruses.',\n",
       "  'In 2007, the large-scale phase IIB Merck trial was abruptly terminated because there was evidence that the individuals vaccinated with adenovirus rAd5 vector (expressing gag, pol and nef) became more vulnerable to HIV-1 infection in comparison to controls. It was suggested that the group with the increased risk of being infected with HIV-1 consisted of individuals who were Ad5 seropositive  . Other eukaryotic viruses that infect other species and do not replicate in human cells were also tested as candidates HIV vaccine carriers and in theory are safer. For example, the canarypox vector was used in the RV144 phase III clinical trial, the only clinical trial that had positive results to date, offering partial protection (31%) to vaccinated individuals in comparison with control [152, 153] . Apart from safety reasons, the use of adenovirus-based vectors has not been protective.',\n",
       "  'The recent HVTV 505 phase IIB trial that used adenovirus rAd5 as a boost and DNA as prime for vaccination of 2504 human volunteers was abandoned as futile  . Recently, a rhesus macaque cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vector successfully induced a persisting CTL response in rhesus macaques that strongly protected the vaccinated animals from challenge against the pathogenic SIVmac239 strain. Importantly, this study, 50% of the vaccinated animals reduced the viral load to undetectable levels [141, 142] . However, the design of a human version of this CMV vector could impose safety risks, since the human CMV is a persistent and pathogenic human virus  . Therefore, various types of eukaryotic viral vectors are currently under investigation. These are reviewed elsewhere [154, 155] . However, the use of a eukaryotic virus is accompanied by serious safety concerns. As an alternative, the use of prokaryotic viruses such as inoviruses, may be utilized which have a decisively lower safety risk to humans.',\n",
       "  'Even if inoviruses could infect a eukaryotic cell, the assembly of the new prokaryotic virions cannot take place without the specific conditions that exist in the inter-membrane area of the E. coli and without the presence of the specific E. coli enzyme leader peptidase that does not exist in human cells [156, 157] . Furthermore, there was a phase I case study in 2006 where fd inoviruses were intravenously infused in humans (for purposes unrelated to vaccination), causing no side effects or even allergic reactions in any of the eight volunteers. To our knowledge, this is the only case where inoviruses were infused in humans  . Therefore, in contrast to other viral vectors, the use of inoviruses does not impose a major safety risk to humans.',\n",
       "  \"This characteristic of inoviral vectors along with their capability to trigger both cellular and humoral immune responses makes them an attractive option as vaccine vectors.During the last two decades, inoviral vectors have been used in the development of vaccines against various infectious parasites and against non-infectious diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's with promising results. While the applications of inovirus display technology in vaccine design against non-HIV-1 diseases have been mostly successful, the design of a HIV-1 vaccine development has so far been disappointing. A major obstacle has been the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies plagued with autoreactivity properties. Screening of RPLs with these antibodies resulted in the isolation of peptides that, as vaccine antigens, were unsuccessful in inducing a specific humoral response that would produce neutralizing antibodies. The recent isolation of antibodies such as VRC01 and 10E8 with more neutralizing breadth and potency without autoreactivity properties than the previously utilized antibodies may overcome this obstacle [115, 124] .\",\n",
       "  'Particularly, the induction of VRC01-like and 10E8-like antibodies could be a feasible target, since these antibodies also seem to be produced from a significant percentage of the HIV-1-infected population [115, 126, 127] . While humoral responses have been well documented, cellular responses have not been assessed in most studies for the design of a HIV-1 vaccine using inoviruses. The only study in which a cellular anti-HIV-1 response was detected also reported a successful induction of a long-lasting memory CTL response seven months after a single vaccination in mice with inoviral particles  , demonstrating that the induction of cellular immunity against HIV-1 using inoviruses is feasible. IAVs are advantageous in that they can induce both arms of adaptive immunity. This finding could therefore be of importance in future efforts for the design of a HIV-1 vaccine.Moreover, IAVs have unique characteristics compared to other viral vectors: they are stable, they can display a peptide in multiple (from few to thousands) copies on their surface and such constructs are very immunogenic without the use of an adjuvant.',\n",
       "  'In addition, IAVs allow the immune system to focus on a specific epitope of interest instead of the whole protein, which is of great importance, since an important aspect for successful HIV-1 vaccine design is to focus on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the specific neutralizing epitopes while at the same time avoiding the induction of ineffective antibodies against the numerous non-neutralizing epitopes of the HIV-1 glycoproteins, which act as decoys for the immune system. Ideally, an effective HIV-1 vaccine should be able to stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses. Recently, adenoviral vectors were tested in clinical trials as HIV-1 vaccine carriers in order to induce cellular immunity, but they were shown to impose serious health risks for humans. On the other hand, IAVs are able to induce cellular immunity and at the same time they have been demonstrated to be safe for administration in animals and humans.',\n",
       "  'These characteristics of IAVs, conferred by their structural and biological properties, make them effective antigen display vectors that can induce strong and specific humoral and cellular immune responses against the displayed antigen. These properties of IAVs along with newly discovered broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies, pave the way for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.'],\n",
       " ['Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(+) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.',\n",
       "  'These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Text: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length. The 5 two-thirds of the genome encodes large polyprotein precursors, open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF1b, which are proteolytically cleaved to generate 16 non-structural proteins (Tan et al., 2005) . The 3 one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and non-structural proteins, along with a set of accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b) (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tan et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV is the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) .',\n",
       "  'At least 8,098 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection, with a fatality rate of 9.6%, were reported to the World Health Organization from November 2002 to July 2003. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, were detected in autopsy tissues from SARS patients (He et al., 2006) . Although dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in lung injury and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.The innate immune systems utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Medzhitov, 2001; Kawai and Akira, 2010) . Recognition of virus infection plays an important role in limiting virus replication at the early stages of infection. Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including virus infection (Bauernfeind et al., 2011) .',\n",
       "  'Four models describing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been proposed thus far (Hornung and Latz, 2010; Schroder et al., 2010; Tschopp and Schroder, 2010) . First, the disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations, including K + efflux and Ca 2+ influx, play an important role (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Petrilli et al., 2007; Arlehamn et al., 2010; Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013) . Second, cathepsin B and L, which are specific lysosomal cysteine proteases, are though to play a role after phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals (Duewell et al., 2010) , fibrillar peptide amyloid-beta , silica crystals, and aluminum salts . Third is the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial DNA from damaged mitochondria (Zhou et al., , 2011 Nakahira et al., 2011; Shimada et al., 2012) .',\n",
       "  'Finally, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Upon activation, the NLRP3 is recruited to the mitochondria via association with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) or mitofusin 2 expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane Subramanian et al., 2013) ; these molecules then recruit the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. This event activates the downstream molecule, caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms and stimulates their secretion (Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015) .It is increasingly evident that NLRP3 detects RNA viruses by sensing the cellular damage or distress induced by viroporins (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) , transmembrane pore-forming proteins, encoded by certain RNA viruses; these proteins alter membrane permeability to ions by forming membrane channels (Tan et al., 2005; Chen and Ichinohe, 2015) .',\n",

       "  'In addition, the SARS-CoV E protein acts as a Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto- Torres et al., 2015) . The fact that 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as viroporin prompted us to examine whether it also triggers inflammasome activation. Thus, we first generated lentivirus plasmids expressing V5-tagged proteins and confirmed their expression in HEK293FT cells by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1A-C) . We next transduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed BMMs with the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, 3a, M, influenza virus M2, or EMCV 2B proteins. Consistent with previous reports (Ichinohe et al., Figure 1D) . Similarly, the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins stimulated IL-1β release from LPS-primed BMMs ( Figure 1D) . Furthermore, IL-1β secretion from LPSprimed BMMs co-infected with E-and 3a-expressing lentiviruses was significantly higher than that from SARS-CoV E-expressing lentivirus-infected cells ( Figure 1E) .',\n",
       "  'These data indicated that the expression of SARS-CoV viroporin 3a is sufficient to stimulate IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed BMMs.Previous studies demonstrated that the N-terminal 40 amino acids of the SARS-CoV E protein are important for ion channel formation, and that mutations N15A and V25F [located in the transmembrane domain (from amino acid residues 7-38)] prevent ion conductivity (Wilson et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2007; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV 3a protein contains a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid residues 127-133) that is involved in the formation of a homodimer to generate the ion channel (Lu et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2009) . Thus, mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein (Chan et al., 2009) . To this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS (Chan et al., 2009; Figure 2A) .',\n",

Consistent with a previous report (Nieto -Torres et al., 2015) , we found that the V25F mutant lentivirus failed to stimulate IL-1β release from BMMs ( Figure 2B) . Notably, the 3a-CS mutant completely abrogated IL-1β secretion (Figure 2B) , suggesting that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein is required for SARS-CoV 3a-induced IL-1β secretion.FIGURE 4 | NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV 3a.

In addition, the 3a proteins concentrated in spot structures, which mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 3B ). By contrast, the 3a-CS mutant was concentrated in the Golgi apparatus rather than in the ER and did not form spot structures (Figures 3A,B) . We next examined the intracellular localization of NLRP3.',\n",
       "  'Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome led to a redistribution from the cytosol to the perinuclear space, a process considered as a hallmark of NLRP3 activation (Zhou et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Moriyama et al., 2016) . Although cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm, it was redistributed to the perinuclear region in SARS-CoV 3a-or E-expressing cells (Figure 4) . Together, these data provide evidence that the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome.Both K + Efflux and ROS Production Are Involved in the IL-1β Release Induced by the SARS-CoV 3a ProteinFinally, we investigated the mechanism by which SARS-CoV 3a triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A previous study showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) .',\n",
       "  'In addition, K + efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Mariathasan et al., 2006; Petrilli et al., 2007) . These observations prompted us to examine whether K + efflux is required for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. To this end, BMMs in K + -rich medium were infected with influenza A virus or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. In agreement with a previous result (Ichinohe et al., 2010) , we found that IL-1β secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked when the extracellular K + concentration was increased to 130 mM ( Figure 5A) . The inhibitory effect of the K + -rich medium was also observed when cells were stimulated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins ( Figure 5B ).',\n",
       "  'Since mitochondrial ROS are important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) , we next stimulated BMMs with extracellular ATP or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO, a scavenger that is specific for mitochondrial ROS Trnka et al., 2009) . As reported previously (Nakahira et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012) , treatment of BMMs with Mito-TEMPO completely blocked IL-1β secretion in response to ATP ( Figure 6A) . Similarly, IL-1β release induced by the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins was significantly inhibited by Mito-TEMPO ( Figure 6B) . These observations indicate that the SARS-CoV 3a protein disrupts intracellular ionic concentrations and causes mitochondrial damages, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.In summary, we found that the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.',\n",
       "  'In addition, both K + efflux and mitochondrial ROS production are required for SARS-CoV 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion.Thus far, several models have been proposed to explain NLRP3 inflammasome activation by RNA viruses. First, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Second, viroporins encoded by RNA viruses activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In the case of influenza virus, the proton-selective M2 ion channel in the acidic trans-Golgi network activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010) .',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, an M2 mutant in which histidine was substituted with glycine at position 37 (H37G), causing loss of proton selectivity, enables transport of other cations (i.e., Na + and K + ), thereby leading to enhanced secretion of IL-1β from LPS-primed BMMs and dendritic cells when compared with the wild-type M2 protein.In addition, the 2B proteins of EMCV, poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (a member of the Picornaviridae family) triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing Ca 2+ flux from the ER and Golgi compartments (Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013) . Furthermore, hepatitis C virus stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production though its p7 viroporin (Negash et al., 2013; Farag et al., 2017) . Third, a recent study has demonstrated that the 3D protein of EV71 directly interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Wang et al., 2017) .In the case of SARS-CoV, the viroporin E forms forms Ca 2+permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) .',\n",
       "  'In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Yue et al., 2018) . Although alanine substitution at Cys-133, which is required for dimer or tetramer formation (Lu et al., 2006) , still allows activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting with caspase-1 (Yue et al., 2018) , the ion channel activity-loss mutant 3a-CS (Cys-to-Ser substitution at positions Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133) (Chan et al., 2009 ) completely abrogated IL-1β secretion from LPS-primed BMMs, suggesting that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has the ability to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by multiple mechanisms. Previous studies show that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is localized to the plasma membrane (Minakshi and Padhan, 2014) and acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) , thereby (presumably) stimulating the K + efflux at the plasma membrane.',\n",
       "  'Indeed, we found that IL-1β secretion caused by the 3a protein was significantly inhibited when the extracellular K + concentration increased to 130 mM. Although it remains unclear whether another viroporin 8a of SARS-CoV (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, these data highlights the importance of viroporins in SARS-CoV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A better understanding of the mechanism that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome will facilitate the development of more effective interventions for the treatment of infectious diseases and increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis.'],\n",

RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression.

Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been implicated as important cellular signaling molecules activated by mycobacteria  . Previous reports have shown that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 are required in the induction of TNF-α expression in human monocytes infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv  . We have further revealed the significant role of MAPKs in the signal transduction events of mycobacterial activation of primary human blood monocytes (PBMo) leading to cytokine expressions via the interaction with PKR  . However, the subsequent events as to how MAPK is regulated and how such regulation affects cytokine production in response to mycobacteria remain to be elucidated.Since MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of MAPKs seems to be an efficient process to inactivate their activities.',\n",
       "  'It can be achieved by specific protein kinase phosphatases which can remove the phosphate group from MAPKs. Examples of these phosphatases include tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Some DUSPs are also known as MAPK phosphatases (MKPs)    . Currently, there are at least 10 MKPs identified, while MKP-1 is the most studied member of the family. The regulatory role of MKP-1 on cytokine induction is best demonstrated by MKP-1 knockout (KO) macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. MKP-1 KO macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK as well as increased production of TNF-α in response to LPS treatment  . Consistent with these results, another group further revealed that LPS-treated MKP-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages show increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity  .',\n",
       "  'Also, they showed that LPS-induced MKP-1 expression is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)  , thus demonstrating the role of MKP-1 in signal transduction.Not only LPS, other TLR inducers including CpG, peptidoglycan, poly IC, and Pam 3 Cys can regulate cytokine expressions including TNF-α, IL-10 via MKP-1 activities [10, 11] . In these processes, MKP-1 serves to mitigate the undesirable effects of septic shock and maintain organ functions by restraining the inflammatory responses following bacterial infection. Another example of MKP-1 function is the immune response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a Gram positive bacteria. There are higher levels of cytokine production including TNF-α, IL-6, and MIP-1α in MKP-1 KO mice infected with S. aureus  . Also, the mice would have a rapid development of multiorgan dysfunction as well as faster mortality rate upon challenge with heat-killed S. aureus  .',\n",
       "  'Taken together, these results suggest that MKP-1 protects the host from overactivation of the immune system in response to Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria.In the past, it was believed that different MKP/DUSP family members have overlapping functions. However, the emergence of DUSP2 turned the concept up side down  . It was shown that DUSP2 behaves differently and is opposite to the function as stated above. In DUSP2 KO cells, they produced less inflammatory mediators, implying that DUSP2 may play a role in mediating instead of limiting inflammation. For instances, when DUSP2 KO macrophages were treated with LPS, there were less TNF, IL-6, nitric oxide, IL-12-producing cells when compared to those of the wild type counterparts  .',\n",
       "  'When the DUSP2 KO bone marrow-derived mast cells were first sensitized with immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcεRI) and then stimulated with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen, they produced lower TNF mRNA levels, diminished IL-6 production, less phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and less transcriptional activities by Elk1 and NFAT-AP-1  .These unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by DUSP2 have been hypothesized to be due to crosstalks between MAPKs  . Stimulation of KO mast cells and macrophages showed increases in phosphorylation of JNK. Moreover, inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitors showed increases in phosphorylation of ERK  . The authors also showed that there were physical interactions of DUSP2 with ERK2, DUSP2 with JNK2, as well as DUSP2 and p38 MAPK after stimulation of the cells with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen. Nevertheless, the details of the crosstalks between MAPKs and phosphatases need further investigation.',\n",
       "  'Thus, the MKP family plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses.Innate immune response protects the host from MTB infection by secretion of cytokines including TNF-α in immune cells. Meanwhile, MAPK is one of the critical proteins in the regulation of immunity and cytokine expression. Since MAPK is regulated by MKP-1 in response to LPS and the activation of MAPK is important in BCGinduced cytokine expression, we hypothesize that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the immune regulation of BCG in human monocytes. We examined the involvement of MKP-1 in BCG-induced MAPK activation and its consequent cytokine expression. Here, we present evidences that MKP-1 plays an unexpected role in the regulation of cytokine induction by BCG through its control of MAPK phosphorylation.It has been reported that many inducers including growth factors, LPS, peptidoglycan, and dexamethasone can stimulate the expression of MKP-1 in human macrophages, microglia, mast cells or fibroblasts  .',\n",
       "  'To investigate the role of different TLR inducers in MKP-1 induction process in human blood monocytes, the level of MKP-1 mRNA was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) method. PBMo were isolated from primary human blood mononuclear cells and stimulated with Pam 3 Cys (TLR2 agonist), poly IC (TLR3 agonist), or LPS (TLR4 agonist) for 1 and 3 hours. Following exposure to Pam 3 Cys or LPS, there were significant inductions of MKP-1 mRNA levels within 1 hour of treatment ( Figure 1A ). These effects on MKP-1 induction continued for 3 hours post-treatment with Pam 3 Cys ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, poly IC did not induce MKP-1 ( Figure 1A ). The results indicate that different inducers showed differential up-regulation of MKP-1 expression.LPS has been extensively used to demonstrate the role of MKP-1 in immune response both in vivo and in vitro [9, 12] .',\n",
       "  'To establish a foundation for interpretation of subsequent experimental results, LPS was used as a positive control for the induction of MKP-1 expression. To determine the levels of MKP-1 in response to LPS, kinetics of MKP-1 transcription were determined by QPCR. There was a significant induction of MKP-1 mRNA, which peaked as early as 1 hour upon LPS stimulation, and the levels gradually decreased over a course of 6 hours. These results showed that LPS induced MKP-1 expression (Figure 1B) .Next, to demonstrate the induction of specific phosphatases by BCG, kinetics of MKP-1 expression in PBMo was studied by using QPCR during BCG treatment. Similar to the results produced by LPS, upon the addition of BCG (MOI = 1 CFU/cell), there was a significant induction of MKP-1 mRNA within 1 hour of BCG treatment as determined by Taqman probe specific for MKP-1 ( Figure 2A ).',\n",
       "  'The effects lasted for at least 6 hours ( Figure 2A ).To examine whether the changes of protein production were in parallel to that of the mRNA levels, the protein levels of MKP-1 were measured by Western blotting. In response to BCG, PBMo produced the MKP-1 protein as early as 30 minutes after treatment. The protein levels were maintained for 2 hours and dropped to basal levels at 3 hours ( Figure 2B ). The results demonstrated that there was MKP-1 induction in response to BCG activation in human monocytes.It has been shown that inhibition of p38 MAPK either by specific inhibitor or siRNA reduced the expression of MKP-1 in LPS-or peptidoglycan-treated macrophages  . To determine the mechanisms involved in the BCGinduced MKP-1 expression, PBMo were pretreated with several inhibitors including PD98059 (inhibitor for MAP kinase kinase [MEK] or ERK1/2), SB203580 (inhibitor for p38 MAPK), SP600125 (inhibitor for JNK), and CAPE (inhibitor for NF-κB) for 1 hour.',\n",
       "  'A range of concentrations of each inhibitor was used to test their optimal concentrations and effects on cell viability and kinase inhibitions. BCG was added afterwards and total RNA was harvested. The results demonstrated that, with the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activities by their corresponding relatively specific inhibitors, MKP-1 expressions were significantly reduced ( Figure 3 ). In addition, using higher dose of SB203580, we showed that the inhibition is increased further (data not shown). On the contrary, pretreatment of the cells with CAPE and SP600125 did not affect the induction of MKP-1 by BCG ( Figure 3 ). These results suggest that BCG-induced MKP-1 expression is dependent on both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Throughout the above experiments, the primary goal was to examine the induction of MKP-1 by BCG in human monocytes. Thus, to further examine the role of MKP-1 in BCG-induced signaling, transfection of siRNA into PBMo was used to knockdown the activity of MKP-1.',\n",
       "  'To demonstrate that the MKP-1 siRNA can indeed knockdown the target gene, PBMo were first transfected with control or MKP-1 siRNA and then treated with BCG for 3 hours. Levels of MKP-1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR method.In Figure 4A , BCG stimulated MKP-1 expression (lanes 1 and 2). In MKP-1 siRNA transfected monocytes, induction of MKP-1 by BCG was significantly decreased (lanes 2 and 4). The results showed that the siRNA does abrogate the levels of MKP-1 mRNA.To further determine whether MKP-1 siRNA affects BCGinduced MKP-1 at protein levels, PBMo were treated as above and MKP-1 proteins were measured by Western blotting. The results showed that BCG could induce MKP-1 proteins as usual for cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 4B , lanes 1-3). However, the levels of BCGinduced MKP-1 protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA ( Figure 4B , lanes 4-6).',\n",
       "  'Together, the results suggest that MKP-1 siRNA not only reduced the MKP-1 mRNA in BCG treatment but also abrogated the BCG-induced MKP-1 protein.As stated in the literature  , MKP-1 KO mice showed increased TNF-α production in response to LPS. On the basis of the above MKP-1 siRNA results, LPS was then used as a control to demonstrate the effects of this MKP-1 siRNA system. cytokine expression induced by LPS in MKP-1 siRNA transfected cells suggest that the siRNA system is effective in knocking down the MKP-1 expression and MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator in LPS-induced TNF-α expression.To investigate the effect of MKP-1 siRNA on BCG-induced cytokine expression, the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA were measured by QPCR method. PBMo were transfected with either control or MKP-1 siRNA. Following exposure to BCG with control siRNA, there were significant inductions of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels for 3 hours after treatment as previously reported (  and data not shown).',\n",
       "  'Next, the effects of MKP-1 siRNA were examined on the cytokine expression induced by BCG. Surprisingly, there was a significant abrogation of BCGinduced TNF-α expression by MKP-1 siRNA ( Figure 4D ). With the knockdown of MKP-1, the level of BCG-induced TNF-α was only 60% compared to that of the control cells, while BCG-induced IL-6 and IL-10 were unchanged in MKP-1 siRNA transfected cells. The results revealed that MKP-1 plays a role in the induction of TNF-α expression upon BCG stimulation, which may be different from that of its conventional functions in which MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator in LPS-induced signaling pathways  .The unexpected observations in cytokine expression lead to the investigation on the effects of MKP-1 siRNA on BCG-induced MAPK activation. MKP-1 was found to have a preferential substrate binding to p38 MAPK and JNK than ERK1/2  . The phosphorylation status of MAPKs was assessed in control or MKP-1 siRNA transfected PBMo.',\n",
       "  'Western blotting results demonstrated that BCGinduced both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 15 minutes (data not shown) and peaked at 30 minutes, and then returned to basal levels in cells treated with the control siRNA ( Figure 5 ). Similar to the results of cytokine expression, phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in response to BCG was decreased in monocytes transfected with MKP-1 siRNA instead of the expected increase in phosphorylation ( Figure 5 ). The results suggest that MKP-1 knockdown would result in reduced MAPK phosphorylation by BCG, implying that the reduced level of TNF-α production in BCG stimulated monocytes is due to reduced phosphorylation of MAPKs by MKP-1 siRNA.This report presented evidences that a novel function of MKP-1 is uncovered in cytokine regulation in response to mycobacterial infection. BCG induces MKP-1 as a rapid response (Figure 2) .',\n",
       "  'The induction mechanism of MKP-1 by BCG is dependent on both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK ( Figure 3 ). Using siRNA approach, the functions of MKP-1 can be examined in primary human monocytes. The results showed that the BCG-induced MAPKs activation as well as cytokine expression are downstream of MKP-1 ( Figures 4D and 5) . Thus, MKP-1 is a critical signaling molecule that is involved in BCG-induced cytokine expression.Previous reports have shown that MKP-1 induced by LPS or peptidoglycan is dependent on p38 MAPK  . Accordingly, BCG-induced MKP-1 can be inhibited by both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Interestingly, it has been shown that degradation of MKP-1 is reduced after ERK1/2 phosphorylation  . It can be hypothesized that BCG-induced MKP-1 proteins can be stabilized by ERK1/2 and the detailed mechanisms involved require more exploration.',\n",
       "  'Also, since the inhibition of MKP-1 expression by both inhibitors (for p38 MAPK and ERK1/ 2) was not complete, it is believed that other proteins may be involved in the BCG-induced MKP-1 expression.On the basis of the literature results on LPS effects ( Figure 6 ), the original expectation for this project is that MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator. LPS-stimulated MKP-1 KO peritoneal macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK as well as increased production of TNF-α  . In doing so, LPS-induced MKP-1 could BCG-induced MAPK phosphorylation is decreased by MKP-1 siRNA prevent prolonged TNF-α production as in sepsis which may lead to severe damage to the host. It was expected that BCG induces MKP-1 and its induction would correlate with the dephosphorylation of MAPKs including p38 MAPK. By blocking the MKP-1 using siRNA, it was expected to have increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and prolonged TNF-α production in response to BCG.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, our results shown here are diametrically opposite. One possibility for the unexpected results may be due to non-specific effects of transfection or siRNA. However, this was not the case since there was a prolonged and increased TNF-α expression after the MKP-1 siRNA-transfected monocytes were treated with LPS (Figure 4C ).There is now a new hypothesis to explain such paradoxical effects of MKP-1 in TNF-α regulation in which the phosphatase plays a role in positive regulation of TNF-α production in response to BCG as in the case of DUSP2  . The structures of MKP-1 and DUSP2 are similar, with which they both contain a MAPK-interacting domain and a phosphatase catalytic site. By contrast, other DUSP may have extra domains, e.g., PEST  . Here, we postulate that the function of MKP-1 in BCG-induced signaling is similar to that of the DUSP2/PAC1.Actually, the discovery of DUSP2 has initially created some paradoxical questions.',\n",
       "  'As described, DUSP2 behaves differently from other MKP family members  . In DUSP2 KO macrophages treated with LPS, they produced less inflammatory mediators including less TNF, IL-6, nitric oxide, and IL-12-producing cells, when compared to that of the wild type counterparts  . Indeed, the results of these published studies on DUSP2 studies are quite similar to that of our reported results here.It is plausible that these unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by DUSP2 were due to crosstalks between MAPKs  . It was shown that there are interactions between JNK and ERK1/2 pathways  .Here, we showed that the sustained activation of JNK blocks ERK activation ( Figure 6 ). In the DUSP2 situation, stimulation of KO mast cells and macrophages shows increased phosphorylation of JNK, and inhibition of JNK by its own specific inhibitor restores phosphorylation of ERK1/2  .In the BCG-MKP-1 situation, there is an early phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, it is possible that JNK may play a role in the crosstalk interaction of MAPK. However, our preliminary data suggest that the level of phosphorylated JNK was not increased in PBMo MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection Figure 6 MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. LPS model was provided according to literature findings (Left). In this scenario, LPS activates MKP-1, which in turn dephosphorylates and deactivates phospho-p38 MAPK, resulting in less TNF-α induction. However, the situation in DHP-HSA activation of DUSP2 is more complicated (Middle), since the phosphatase activity causes subsequent inhibition of phospho-JNK which leads to the derepression of phospho-p38 MAPK. Consequently, the combined effects of this cascade results in more TNF-α expression. The unexpected antimycobacterial role of MKP-1 (Right) may be explained by events similar to the DUSP2 effects.',\n",
       "  'In this case (Right), there was an inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases downstream of MKP-1, and the unknown factor in turn inhibits MAPKs activation leading to more TNF-α induction. The details and kinase targets are yet to be identified. transfected with MKP-1 siRNA (data not shown). Thus, the details of the crosstalk between MAPKs need further investigation. Here, we present a model to summarize the results and to hypothesize the existence of an as yet unidentified intermediary factor or factors in the pathways downstream of MKP-1 effects in the BCG-induced signaling cascade. The unexpected antimycobacterial role of MKP-1 ( Figure 6 ) may be explained by events similar to the DUSP2 effects. In this case, BCG induces MKP-1 expression while also activates MAPKs including p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Downstream of MKP-1, there is an inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases.',\n",
       "  \"The unknown factor in turn inhibits MAPKs activation, which ultimately leads to more TNF-α induction ( Figure 6 ).In summary, MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. Inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases downstream of MKP-1, which in turn inhibits MAPKs activation, may be used to explain the novel function of MKP-1 in enhancing MAPK activity and consequent TNF-α expression following BCG treatment ( Figure 6 ). Taken together, the role of MAPK crosstalks need further exploration. (3) TNF-α, 30 cycles (TM = 56°C), upstream, 5'-GGCTCCAGGCGGTGCTTGTTC-3', downstream, 5'-AGACGGCGATGCGGCTGATG-3'.

       " ['Despite the availability of an inactivated vaccine that has been licensed for >50 years, the influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains. Thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity. In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses. This review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines.Text: Seasonal influenza is a worldwide health problem causing high mobility and substantial mortality     . Moreover, influenza infection often worsens preexisting medical conditions    . Vaccines against circulating influenza strains are available and updated annually, but many issues are still present, including low efficacy in the populations at greatest risk of complications from influenza virus infection, i.e., the young and elderly [8, 9] . Despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing [8, 10] , and substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently approved anti-viral drugs [11, 12] .',\n",
       "  'While adjuvants have the potential to improve efficacy and availability of current inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated and virus-vectored vaccines are still considered one of the best options for the induction of broad and efficacious immunity to the influenza virus  .The general types of influenza vaccines available in the United States are trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; in trivalent and quadrivalent forms). There are three types of inactivated vaccines that include whole virus inactivated, split virus inactivated, and subunit vaccines. In split virus vaccines, the virus is disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. TIV is administered intramuscularly and contains three or four inactivated viruses, i.e., two type A strains (H1 and H3) and one or two type B strains.',\n",
       "  'TIV efficacy is measured by induction of humoral responses to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, the major surface and attachment glycoprotein on influenza. Serum antibody responses to HA are measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay, and the strain-specific HI titer is considered the gold-standard correlate of immunity to influenza where a four-fold increase in titer post-vaccination, or a HI titer of ≥1:40 is considered protective [4, 14] . Protection against clinical disease is mainly conferred by serum antibodies; however, mucosal IgA antibodies also may contribute to resistance against infection. Split virus inactivated vaccines can induce neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibody responses    , and anti-NA antibodies have been associated with protection from infection in humans      . Currently, NA-specific antibody responses are not considered a correlate of protection  . LAIV is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone  .',\n",
       "  'LAIV are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature, but replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx  . LAIV immunization induces serum antibody responses, mucosal antibody responses (IgA), and T cell responses. While robust serum antibody and nasal wash (mucosal) antibody responses are associated with protection from infection, other immune responses, such as CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses may contribute to protection and there is not a clear correlate of immunity for LAIV [4, 14, 24] .Currently licensed influenza virus vaccines suffer from a number of issues. The inactivated vaccines rely on specific antibody responses to the HA, and to a lesser extent NA proteins for protection. The immunodominant portions of the HA and NA molecules undergo a constant process of antigenic drift, a natural accumulation of mutations, enabling virus evasion from immunity [9, 25] .',\n",
       "  'Thus, the circulating influenza A and B strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines, Replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection [4, 26, 27] . For the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in February and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall  . If the prediction is imperfect, or if manufacturers have issues with vaccine production, vaccine efficacy or availability can be compromised  . LAIV is not recommended for all populations; however, it is generally considered to be as effective as inactivated vaccines and may be more efficacious in children [4, 9, 24] .',\n",
       "  'While LAIV relies on antigenic match and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the TIV [4, 9] , there is some suggestion that LAIV may induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses [9, 23, 29] . While overall both TIV and LAIV are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines  . Moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery    .Virus-vectored vaccines share many of the advantages of LAIV, as well as those unique to the vectors. Recombinant DNA systems exist that allow ready manipulation and modification of the vector genome.',\n",
       "  'This in turn enables modification of the vectors to attenuate the virus or enhance immunogenicity, in addition to adding and manipulating the influenza virus antigens. Many of these vectors have been extensively studied or used as vaccines against wild type forms of the virus. Finally, each of these vaccine vectors is either replication-defective or causes a self-limiting infection, although like LAIV, safety in immunocompromised individuals still remains a concern [4, 13,    . Table 1 summarizes the benefits and concerns of each of the virus-vectored vaccines discussed here.There are 53 serotypes of adenovirus, many of which have been explored as vaccine vectors. A live adenovirus vaccine containing serotypes 4 and 7 has been in use by the military for decades, suggesting adenoviruses may be safe for widespread vaccine use  . However, safety concerns have led to the majority of adenovirus-based vaccine development to focus on replication-defective vectors.',\n",
       "  'Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is the most-studied serotype, having been tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents, as well as for infectious disease vaccines.Adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable and there are a variety of recombinant systems available which can accommodate up to 10 kb of recombinant genetic material  . Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus which is relatively stable and can be formulated for long-term storage at 4 °C, or even storage up to six months at room temperature  . Adenovirus vaccines can be grown to high titers, exceeding 10 1° plaque forming units (PFU) per mL when cultured on 293 or PER.C6 cells  , and the virus can be purified by simple methods  . Adenovirus vaccines can also be delivered via multiple routes, including intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, oral delivery using a protective capsule, and by intranasal delivery.',\n",
       "  'Importantly, the latter two delivery methods induce robust mucosal immune responses and may bypass preexisting vector immunity  . Even replication-defective adenovirus vectors are naturally immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. Adenovirus has been extensively studied as a vaccine vector for human disease. The first report using adenovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza demonstrated immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) expressing the HA of a swine influenza virus, A/Swine/Iowa/1999 (H3N2). Intramuscular immunization of mice with this construct induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from challenge with a heterologous virus, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2)  . Replication defective rAd5 vaccines expressing influenza HA have also been tested in humans. A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate and higher geometric meant HI titers  .',\n",
       "  'While clinical trials with rAd vectors have overall been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy, rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. The first trial was a gene therapy examination where high-dose intravenous delivery of an Ad vector resulted in the death of an 18-year-old male [42, 43] . The second clinical failure was using an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine being tested as a part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1    . Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed  .',\n",
       "  'While these two instances do not suggest Ad-vector vaccines are unsafe or inefficacious, the umbra cast by the clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines, but interest still remains.Immunization with adenovirus vectors induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses that are initiated through toll-like receptor-dependent and independent pathways which induce robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Recombinant Ad vaccines expressing HA antigens from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV), and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models, including chickens, mice, and ferrets, and been shown to be efficacious and provide protection from challenge [48, 49] . Several rAd5 vectors have been explored for delivery of non-HA antigens, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 2 (M2) protein [29,    . The efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity [53, 54] .',\n",
       "  'However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use  .One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] .',\n",
       "  'Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity  .Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types  . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] .AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated  .',\n",
       "  'As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well  .There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001  . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice  . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection.',\n",
       "  'Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge  . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines  .Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family.',\n",
       "  'A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material.The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels  .SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus     . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine  .',\n",
       "  'A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks  . A recombinant SIN virus was use as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge  . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult (8-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) mice from lethal homologous challenge  .The VEE replicon systems are particularly appealing as the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses  . VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization    , and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies  .',\n",
       "  'VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe  . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost  . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity.Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season  . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors.',\n",
       "  'Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells  . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors.Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA)  . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge.',\n",
       "  'The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection  . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response.Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. Intramuscular immunization of mice or chickens with BV-G-HA elicited strong HI and VN serum antibody responses, IFN-γ responses, and protected from H5N1 challenge  . A separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector  .Baculovirus has also been used to generate an inactivated particle vaccine. The HA of A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006(H5N1) was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from White Spot Syndrome Virus.',\n",
       "  'The resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine [81, 82] . Intranasal delivery with cholera toxin B as an adjuvant elicited robust HI titers and protected from lethal challenge  . Oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice, and protected from H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, co-formulations of inactivated baculovirus vectors have also been shown to be effective in mice  .While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time.Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector.',\n",
       "  \"As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector  .Reverse genetics, a method that allows NDV to be rescued from plasmids expressing the viral RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid proteins, was first reported in 1999 [85, 86] . This process has enabled manipulation of the NDV genome as well as incorporation of transgenes and the development of NDV vectors.\",\n",
       "  'Influenza was the first infectious disease targeted with a recombinant NDV (rNDV) vector. The HA protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was inserted into the Hitchner B1 vaccine strain. The HA protein was expressed on infected cells and was incorporated into infectious virions. While the virus was attenuated compared to the parental vaccine strain, it induced a robust serum antibody response and protected against homologous influenza virus challenge in a murine model of infection  . Subsequently, rNDV was tested as a vaccine vector for HPAIV having varying efficacy against H5 and H7 influenza virus infections in poultry        . These vaccines have the added benefit of potentially providing protection against both the influenza virus and NDV infection.NDV has also been explored as a vaccine vector for humans. Two NHP studies assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of an rNDV expressing the HA or NA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203) [95, 96] .',\n",
       "  'Intranasal and intratracheal delivery of the rNDV-HA or rNDV-NA vaccines induced both serum and mucosal antibody responses and protected from HPAIV challenge [95, 96] . NDV has limited clinical data; however, phase I and phase I/II clinical trials have shown that the NDV vector is well-tolerated, even at high doses delivered intravenously [44, 97] . While these results are promising, additional studies are needed to advance NDV as a human vaccine vector for influenza.Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) is a paramyxovirus vaccine vector being explored for delivery of influenza and other infectious disease vaccine antigens. PIV5 has only recently been described as a vaccine vector  . Similar to other RNA viruses, PIV5 has a number of features that make it an attractive vaccine vector. For example, PIV5 has a stable RNA genome and no DNA phase in virus replication cycle reducing concerns of host genome integration or modification.',\n",
       "  \"PIV5 can be grown to very high titers in mammalian vaccine cell culture substrates and is not cytopathic allowing for extended culture and harvest of vaccine virus [98, 99] . Like NDV, PIV5 has a 3'-to 5' gradient of gene expression and insertion of transgenes at different locations in the genome can variably attenuate the virus and alter transgene expression  . PIV5 has broad tropism, infecting many cell types, tissues, and species without causing clinical disease, although PIV5 has been associated with -kennel cough‖ in dogs  . A reverse genetics system for PIV5 was first used to insert the HA gene from A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2) into the PIV5 genome between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene and the large (L) polymerase gene. Similar to NDV, the HA was expressed at high levels in infected cells and replicated similarly to the wild type virus, and importantly, was not pathogenic in immunodeficient mice  .\",\n",
       "  'Additionally, a single intranasal immunization in a murine model of influenza infection was shown to induce neutralizing antibody responses and protect against a virus expressing homologous HA protein  . PIV5 has also been explored as a vaccine against HPAIV. Recombinant PIV5 vaccines expressing the HA or NP from VN1203 were tested for efficacy in a murine challenge model. Mice intranasally vaccinated with a single dose of PIV5-H5 vaccine had robust serum and mucosal antibody responses, and were protected from lethal challenge. Notably, although cellular immune responses appeared to contribute to protection, serum antibody was sufficient for protection from challenge [100, 101] . Intramuscular immunization with PIV5-H5 was also shown to be effective at inducing neutralizing antibody responses and protecting against lethal influenza virus challenge  .',\n",
       "  'PIV5 expressing the NP protein of HPAIV was also efficacious in the murine immunization and challenge model, where a single intranasal immunization induced robust CD8 + T cell responses and protected against homologous (H5N1) and heterosubtypic (H1N1) virus challenge  .Currently there is no clinical safety data for use of PIV5 in humans. However, live PIV5 has been a component of veterinary vaccines for -kennel cough‖ for >30 years, and veterinarians and dog owners are exposed to live PIV5 without reported disease  . This combined with preclinical data from a variety of animal models suggests that PIV5 as a vector is likely to be safe in humans. As preexisting immunity is a concern for all virus-vectored vaccines, it should be noted that there is no data on the levels of preexisting immunity to PIV5 in humans.',\n",
       "  'However, a study evaluating the efficacy of a PIV5-H3 vaccine in canines previously vaccinated against PIV5 (kennel cough) showed induction of robust anti-H3 serum antibody responses as well as high serum antibody levels to the PIV5 vaccine, suggesting preexisting immunity to the PIV5 vector may not affect immunogenicity of vaccines even with repeated use  .Poxvirus vaccines have a long history and the notable hallmark of being responsible for eradication of smallpox. The termination of the smallpox virus vaccination program has resulted in a large population of poxvirus-naï ve individuals that provides the opportunity for the use of poxviruses as vectors without preexisting immunity concerns  . Poxvirus-vectored vaccines were first proposed for use in 1982 with two reports of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding and expressing functional thymidine kinase gene from herpes virus [104, 105] .',\n",
       "  'Within a year, a vaccinia virus encoding the HA of an H2N2 virus was shown to express a functional HA protein (cleaved in the HA1 and HA2 subunits) and be immunogenic in rabbits and hamsters  . Subsequently, all ten of the primary influenza proteins have been expressed in vaccine virus  .Early work with intact vaccinia virus vectors raised safety concerns, as there was substantial reactogenicity that hindered recombinant vaccine development  . Two vaccinia vectors were developed to address these safety concerns. The modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain was attenuated by passage 530 times in chick embryo fibroblasts cultures. The second, New York vaccinia virus (NYVAC) was a plaque-purified clone of the Copenhagen vaccine strain rationally attenuated by deletion of 18 open reading frames    .Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was developed prior to smallpox eradication to reduce or prevent adverse effects of other smallpox vaccines  .',\n",
       "  'Serial tissue culture passage of MVA resulted in loss of 15% of the genome, and established a growth restriction for avian cells. The defects affected late stages in virus assembly in non-avian cells, a feature enabling use of the vector as single-round expression vector in non-permissive hosts. Interestingly, over two decades ago, recombinant MVA expressing the HA and NP of influenza virus was shown to be effective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a murine model  . Subsequently, MVA expressing various antigens from seasonal, pandemic (A/California/04/2009, pH1N1), equine (A/Equine/Kentucky/1/81 H3N8), and HPAI (VN1203) viruses have been shown to be efficacious in murine, ferret, NHP, and equine challenge models  . MVA vaccines are very effective stimulators of both cellular and humoral immunity. For example, abortive infection provides native expression of the influenza antigens enabling robust antibody responses to native surface viral antigens.',\n",
       "  'Concurrently, the intracellular influenza peptides expressed by the pox vector enter the class I MHC antigen processing and presentation pathway enabling induction of CD8 + T cell antiviral responses. MVA also induces CD4 + T cell responses further contributing to the magnitude of the antigen-specific effector functions [107,     . MVA is also a potent activator of early innate immune responses further enhancing adaptive immune responses  . Between early smallpox vaccine development and more recent vaccine vector development, MVA has undergone extensive safety testing and shown to be attenuated in severely immunocompromised animals and safe for use in children, adults, elderly, and immunocompromised persons. With extensive pre-clinical data, recombinant MVA vaccines expressing influenza antigens have been tested in clinical trials and been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans    . These results combined with data from other (non-influenza) clinical and pre-clinical studies support MVA as a leading viral-vectored candidate vaccine.The NYVAC vector is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus strain.',\n",
       "  'NYVAC is replication-restricted; however, it grows in chick embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells enabling vaccine-scale production. In non-permissive cells, critical late structural proteins are not produced stopping replication at the immature virion stage  . NYVAC is very attenuated and considered safe for use in humans of all ages; however, it predominantly induces a CD4 + T cell response which is different compared to MVA  . Both MVA and NYVAC provoke robust humoral responses, and can be delivered mucosally to induce mucosal antibody responses  . There has been only limited exploration of NYVAC as a vaccine vector for influenza virus; however, a vaccine expressing the HA from A/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (H5N1) was shown to induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protect against challenge in swine  .While there is strong safety and efficacy data for use of NYVAC or MVA-vectored influenza vaccines, preexisting immunity remains a concern.',\n",
       "  'Although the smallpox vaccination campaign has resulted in a population of poxvirus-naï ve people, the initiation of an MVA or NYVAC vaccination program for HIV, influenza or other pathogens will rapidly reduce this susceptible population. While there is significant interest in development of pox-vectored influenza virus vaccines, current influenza vaccination strategies rely upon regular immunization with vaccines matched to circulating strains. This would likely limit the use and/or efficacy of poxvirus-vectored influenza virus vaccines for regular and seasonal use  . Intriguingly, NYVAC may have an advantage for use as an influenza vaccine vector, because immunization with this vector induces weaker vaccine-specific immune responses compared to other poxvirus vaccines, a feature that may address the concerns surrounding preexisting immunity  .While poxvirus-vectored vaccines have not yet been approved for use in humans, there is a growing list of licensed poxvirus for veterinary use that include fowlpox-and canarypox-vectored vaccines for avian and equine influenza viruses, respectively [124, 125] .',\n",
       "  \"The fowlpox-vectored vaccine expressing the avian influenza virus HA antigen has the added benefit of providing protection against fowlpox infection. Currently, at least ten poxvirus-vectored vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use  . These poxvirus vectors have the potential for use as vaccine vectors in humans, similar to the first use of cowpox for vaccination against smallpox  . The availability of these non-human poxvirus vectors with extensive animal safety and efficacy data may address the issues with preexisting immunity to the human vaccine strains, although the cross-reactivity originally described with cowpox could also limit use.Influenza vaccines utilizing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus, as a vaccine vector have a number of advantages shared with other RNA virus vaccine vectors. Both live and replication-defective VSV vaccine vectors have been shown to be immunogenic [128, 129] , and like Paramyxoviridae, the Rhabdoviridae genome has a 3'-to-5' gradient of gene expression enabling attention by selective vaccine gene insertion or genome rearrangement  .\",\n",
       "  'VSV has a number of other advantages including broad tissue tropism, and the potential for intramuscular or intranasal immunization. The latter delivery method enables induction of mucosal immunity and elimination of needles required for vaccination. Also, there is little evidence of VSV seropositivity in humans eliminating concerns of preexisting immunity, although repeated use may be a concern. Also, VSV vaccine can be produced using existing mammalian vaccine manufacturing cell lines.Influenza antigens were first expressed in a VSV vector in 1997. Both the HA and NA were shown to be expressed as functional proteins and incorporated into the recombinant VSV particles  . Subsequently, VSV-HA, expressing the HA protein from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was shown to be immunogenic and protect mice from lethal influenza virus challenge  . To reduce safety concerns, attenuated VSV vectors were developed.',\n",
       "  'One candidate vaccine had a truncated VSV G protein, while a second candidate was deficient in G protein expression and relied on G protein expressed by a helper vaccine cell line to the provide the virus receptor. Both vectors were found to be attenuated in mice, but maintained immunogenicity  . More recently, single-cycle replicating VSV vaccines have been tested for efficacy against H5N1 HPAIV. VSV vectors expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) were shown to be immunogenic and induce cross-reactive antibody responses and protect against challenge with heterologous H5N1 challenge in murine and NHP models    .VSV vectors are not without potential concerns. VSV can cause disease in a number of species, including humans  . The virus is also potentially neuroinvasive in some species  , although NHP studies suggest this is not a concern in humans  .',\n",
       "  'Also, while the incorporation of the influenza antigen in to the virion may provide some benefit in immunogenicity, changes in tropism or attenuation could arise from incorporation of different influenza glycoproteins. There is no evidence for this, however  . Currently, there is no human safety data for VSV-vectored vaccines. While experimental data is promising, additional work is needed before consideration for human influenza vaccination.Current influenza vaccines rely on matching the HA antigen of the vaccine with circulating strains to provide strain-specific neutralizing antibody responses [4, 14, 24] . There is significant interest in developing universal influenza vaccines that would not require annual reformulation to provide protective robust and durable immunity. These vaccines rely on generating focused immune responses to highly conserved portions of the virus that are refractory to mutation    .',\n",
       "  'Traditional vaccines may not be suitable for these vaccination strategies; however, vectored vaccines that have the ability to be readily modified and to express transgenes are compatible for these applications.The NP and M2 proteins have been explored as universal vaccine antigens for decades. Early work with recombinant viral vectors demonstrated that immunization with vaccines expressing influenza antigens induced potent CD8 + T cell responses [107,     . These responses, even to the HA antigen, could be cross-protective  . A number of studies have shown that immunization with NP expressed by AAV, rAd5, alphavirus vectors, MVA, or other vector systems induces potent CD8 + T cell responses and protects against influenza virus challenge [52, 63, 69, 102, 139, 142] . As the NP protein is highly conserved across influenza A viruses, NP-specific T cells can protect against heterologous and even heterosubtypic virus challenges  .The M2 protein is also highly conserved and expressed on the surface of infected cells, although to a lesser extent on the surface of virus particles  .',\n",
       "  'Much of the vaccine work in this area has focused on virus-like or subunit particles expressing the M2 ectodomain; however, studies utilizing a DNA-prime, rAd-boost strategies to vaccinate against the entire M2 protein have shown the antigen to be immunogenic and protective  . In these studies, antibodies to the M2 protein protected against homologous and heterosubtypic challenge, including a H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, NP and M2 have been combined to induce broadly cross-reactive CD8 + T cell and antibody responses, and rAd5 vaccines expressing these antigens have been shown to protect against pH1N1 and H5N1 challenges [29, 51] .Historically, the HA has not been widely considered as a universal vaccine antigen. However, the recent identification of virus neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with many subtypes of influenza virus  has presented the opportunity to design vaccine antigens to prime focused antibody responses to the highly conserved regions recognized by these monoclonal antibodies.',\n",
       "  'The majority of these broadly cross-reactive antibodies recognize regions on the stalk of the HA protein  . The HA stalk is generally less immunogenic compared to the globular head of the HA protein so most approaches have utilized -headless‖ HA proteins as immunogens. HA stalk vaccines have been designed using DNA and virus-like particles  and MVA  ; however, these approaches are amenable to expression in any of the viruses vectors described here.The goal of any vaccine is to protect against infection and disease, while inducing population-based immunity to reduce or eliminate virus transmission within the population. It is clear that currently licensed influenza vaccines have not fully met these goals, nor those specific to inducing long-term, robust immunity. There are a number of vaccine-related issues that must be addressed before population-based influenza vaccination strategies are optimized.',\n",
       "  'The concept of a -one size fits all‖ vaccine needs to be updated, given the recent ability to probe the virus-host interface through RNA interference approaches that facilitate the identification of host genes affecting virus replication, immunity, and disease. There is also a need for revision of the current influenza virus vaccine strategies for at-risk populations, particularly those at either end of the age spectrum. An example of an improved vaccine regime might include the use of a vectored influenza virus vaccine that expresses the HA, NA and M and/or NP proteins for the two currently circulating influenza A subtypes and both influenza B strains so that vaccine take and vaccine antigen levels are not an issue in inducing protective immunity. Recombinant live-attenuated or replication-deficient influenza viruses may offer an advantage for this and other approaches.Vectored vaccines can be constructed to express full-length influenza virus proteins, as well as generate conformationally restricted epitopes, features critical in generating appropriate humoral protection.',\n",
       "  'Inclusion of internal influenza antigens in a vectored vaccine can also induce high levels of protective cellular immunity. To generate sustained immunity, it is an advantage to induce immunity at sites of inductive immunity to natural infection, in this case the respiratory tract. Several vectored vaccines target the respiratory tract. Typically, vectored vaccines generate antigen for weeks after immunization, in contrast to subunit vaccination. This increased presence and level of vaccine antigen contributes to and helps sustain a durable memory immune response, even augmenting the selection of higher affinity antibody secreting cells. The enhanced memory response is in part linked to the intrinsic augmentation of immunity induced by the vector. Thus, for weaker antigens typical of HA, vectored vaccines have the capacity to overcome real limitations in achieving robust and durable protection.Meeting the mandates of seasonal influenza vaccine development is difficult, and to respond to a pandemic strain is even more challenging.',\n",
       "  \"Issues with influenza vaccine strain selection based on recently circulating viruses often reflect recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO)-a process that is cumbersome. The strains of influenza A viruses to be used in vaccine manufacture are not wild-type viruses but rather reassortants that are hybrid viruses containing at least the HA and NA gene segments from the target strains and other gene segments from the master strain, PR8, which has properties of high growth in fertilized hen's eggs. This additional process requires more time and quality control, and specifically for HPAI viruses, it is a process that may fail because of the nature of those viruses. In contrast, viral-vectored vaccines are relatively easy to manipulate and produce, and have well-established safety profiles. There are several viral-based vectors currently employed as antigen delivery systems, including poxviruses, adenoviruses baculovirus, paramyxovirus, rhabdovirus, and others; however, the majority of human clinical trials assessing viral-vectored influenza vaccines use poxvirus and adenovirus vectors.\",\n",
       "  ' While each of these vector approaches has unique features and is in different stages of development, the combined successes of these approaches supports the virus-vectored vaccine approach as a whole. Issues such as preexisting immunity and cold chain requirements, and lingering safety concerns will have to be overcome; however, each approach is making progress in addressing these issues, and all of the approaches are still viable. Virus-vectored vaccines hold particular promise for vaccination with universal or focused antigens where traditional vaccination methods are not suited to efficacious delivery of these antigens. The most promising approaches currently in development are arguably those targeting conserved HA stalk region epitopes. Given the findings to date, virus-vectored vaccines hold great promise and may overcome the current limitations of influenza vaccines.'],\n",
       " ['The discovery of exoplanets within putative habitable zones revolutionized astrobiology in recent years. It stimulated interest in the question about the origin of life and its evolution. Here, we discuss what the roles of viruses might have been at the beginning of life and during evolution. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They are present everywhere, in our surrounding, the oceans, the soil and in every living being. Retroviruses contributed to about half of our genomic sequences and to the evolution of the mammalian placenta. Contemporary viruses reflect evolution ranging from the RNA world to the DNA-protein world. How far back can we trace their contribution? Earliest replicating and evolving entities are the ribozymes or viroids fulfilling several criteria of life. RNA can perform many aspects of life and influences our gene expression until today. The simplest structures with non-protein-coding information may represent models of life built on structural, not genetic information.',\n",
       "  'Viruses today are obligatory parasites depending on host cells. Examples of how an independent lifestyle might have been lost include mitochondria, chloroplasts, Rickettsia and others, which used to be autonomous bacteria and became intracellular parasites or endosymbionts, thereby losing most of their genes. Even in vitro the loss of genes can be recapitulated all the way from coding to non-coding RNA. Furthermore, the giant viruses may indicate that there is no sharp border between living and non-living entities but an evolutionary continuum. Here, it is discussed how viruses can lose and gain genes, and that they are essential drivers of evolution. This discussion may stimulate the thinking about viruses as early possible forms of life. Apart from our view “viruses first”, there are others such as “proteins first” and “metabolism first.”Text: Mycoplasma mycoides by systematic deletion of individual genes resulted in a synthetic minimal genome of 473 genes (Hutchison et al., 2016) .',\n",
       "  'Can one consider simpler living entities?There are elements with zero genes that fulfill many criteria for early life: ribozymes, catalytic RNAs closely related to viroids. They were recovered in vitro from 10 15 molecules (aptamers), 220 nucleotides in length, by 10 rounds of selection. Among the many RNA species present in this collection of quasispecies RNAs were catalytically active members, enzymatically active ribozymes. The sequence space for 220-mer RNAs is about 3 × 10 132 (Eigen, 1971; Wilson and Szostak, 1999; Brackett and Dieckmann, 2006) .The selected ribozymes were able to replicate, cleave, join, and form peptide bonds. They can polymerize progeny chemically, allow for mutations to occur and can evolve. One molecule serves as catalyst, the other one as substrate. Replication of ribozymes was demonstrated in the test tube (Lincoln and Joyce, 2009) . Ribozymes can form peptide bonds between amino acids (Zhang and Cech, 1997) .',\n",
       "  'Thus, small peptides were available by ribozyme activity. Consequently, an RNA modification has been proposed as peptide nucleic acid (PNA), with more stable peptide bonds instead of phosphodiester bonds (Zhang and Cech, 1997; Joyce, 2002) . Replication of RNA molecules can be performed chemically from RNA without polymerase enzymes. In addition, deoxyribozymes can form from ribonucleotides (Wilson and Szostak, 1999) . Thus, DNA can arise from RNA chemically, without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase.An entire living world is possible from non-coding RNA (ncRNA) before evolution of the genetic code and protein enzymes. Ribozymes naturally consist of circular single-stranded RNAs (Orgel, 2004) . They lack the genetic triplet code and do not encode proteins. Instead, they exhibit structural information by hairpin-loops that form hydrogen bonds between incomplete double strands, and loops free to interact with other molecules. They represent a quasispecies in which many species of RNA may form, such as ribozymes, tRNA-like molecules, and other ncRNAs.',\n",
       "  'RNAs within such a pool can bind amino acids. Ninety different amino acids have been identified on the Murchison meteorite found in Australia, while on Earth only about 20 of them are used for protein synthesis (Meierhenrich, 2008) . Where formation of ribozymes occurred on the early Earth is a matter of speculation. The hydrothermal vents such as black smokers in the deep ocean are possibilities where life may have started (Martin et al., 2008) . There, temperature gradients and clay containing minerals such as magnesium or manganese are available. Pores or niches offer possibilities for concentration of building blocks, which is required for chemical reactions to occur. Interestingly, also ice is a candidate for ribozyme formation and chemical reactions. Ice crystals displace the biomolecules into the liquid phase, which leads to concentration, creating a quasicellular compartmentalization where de novo synthesis of nucleotide precursors is promoted.',\n",
       "  'There, RNA and ribozymes can emerge, which are capable of self-replication (Attwater et al., 2010) .tRNA-amino acid complexes can find RNAs as \"mRNAs.\" Such interactions could have contributed to the evolution of the genetic code. This sequence of events can lead to primitive ribosome precursors. Ribozymes are the essential catalytic elements in ribosomes: \"The ribosome is a ribozyme\" (Cech, 2000) , supplemented with about a hundred scaffold proteins later during evolution. The proteins have structural functions and contribute indirectly to enzymatic activity. Are these ribosomebound ribozymes fossils from the early Earth? Small peptides can be formed by ribozymes before ribosomes evolved, whereby single or dimeric amino acids may originate from the universe (Meierhenrich, 2008) .Small peptides with basic amino acids can increase the catalytic activity of ribozymes as shown in vitro (Müller et al., 1994) .',\n",
       "  'Such proteins are known as RNA-binding proteins from RNA viruses that protect the RNA genome, with motifs such as RAPRKKG of the nucleocapsid NCp7 of HIV (Schmalzbauer et al., 1996) . Peptides can enhance the catalytic activity of ribozymes up to a 100-fold (Müller et al., 1994) . Such peptides of RNA viruses serve as chaperones that remove higher ordered RNA structures, allowing for more efficient interaction of RNA molecules and increasing transcription rates of RNA polymerases (Müller et al., 1994) . Ribonucleoproteins may have also been functionally important during the evolution of ribosomes (Harish and Caetano-Anolles, 2012) .These pre-ribosomal structures are also similar to precursorlike structures of retroviruses. Reverse transcription can be performed by ribozymes chemically. This action does not necessarily require a protein polymerase such as the reverse transcriptase. Similarly, deoxyribonucleotides can arise by removal of an oxygen without the need of a protein enzyme (a reductase) as today, and allow for DNA polymerization (Wilson and Szostak, 1999; Joyce, 2002) .',\n",
       "  'The same elements of the precursors for ribosomes are also building blocks of retroviruses, which may have a similar evolutionary origin (Moelling, 2012 (Moelling, , 2013 . tRNAs serve as primers for the reverse transcriptase, and the sequence of promoters of transposable elements are derived from tRNAs (Lander et al., 2001) . The ribozymes developed into more complex self-cleaving group II introns with insertion of genes encoding a reverse transcriptase and additional proteins (Moelling and Broecker, 2015; Moelling et al., 2017) (Figure 1) .It came as a surprise that the genomes of almost all species are rich in ncDNA, transcribed into ncRNAs but not encoding proteins, as evidenced, for instance, by the \"Encyclopedia of DNA Elements\" (ENCODE) project. ncDNA amounts to more than 98% of the human DNA genome (Deveson et al., 2017) . Higher organisms tend to have more non-coding information, which allows for more complex modes of gene regulation.',\n",
       "  'The ncRNAs are regulators of the protein-coding sequences. Highly complex organisms such as humans typically have a high number of ncRNA and regulatory mechanisms. ncRNA can range from close to zero in the smallest bacteria such as Pelagibacter ubique to about 98% in the human genome.RNA viruses such as the retrovirus HIV harbor ncRNAs for gene regulation such as the trans-activating response element (TAR), the binding site for the Tat protein for early viral gene expression. Tat has a highly basic domain comprising mostly Lys and Arg residues, resembling other RNA binding proteins. ncRNA also serves on viral RNA genomes as ribosomal entry sites, primer binding sites or packaging signals. DNA synthesis depends on RNA synthesis as initial event, with RNA primers as starters for DNA replication, inside of cells as FIGURE 1 | A compartment is shown with essential components of life as discussed in the text.',\n",

Individual amino acids are indicated as black dots and may be available on Earth from the universe. DNA may have existed before retroviruses. The compartment can be interpreted as pre-virus or pre-cell. Viroid, green; RNA, red; DNA, black.well as during retroviral replication, proving a requirement of RNA (Flint, 2015) .The number of mammalian protein-coding genes is about 20,000. Surprisingly, this is only a fifth of the number of genes of bread wheat (Appels et al., 2018) . Tulips, maize and other plants also have larger genomes, indicating that the number of genes does not necessarily reflect the complexity of an organism. What makes these plant genomes so large, is still an open question.',\n",
       "  'Could the giant genomes possibly be the result to breeding of plants by farmers or gardeners?According to Szostak there are molecules which appear like relics from the RNA world such as acetyl-CoA or vitamin B12, both of which are bound to a ribonucleotide for no obvious reason -was it \"forgotten\" to be removed? (Roberts and Szostak, 1997; Szostak et al., 2001; Szostak, 2011) . Perhaps the connected RNA serves as structural stabilizer. Lipid vesicles could have formed the first compartments and enclosed ribozymes, tRNAs with selected amino acids, and RNA which became mRNA. Is this a pre-cell or pre-virus (Figure 1) ? Patel et al. (2015) demonstrated that the building blocks of life, ribonucleotides, lipids and amino acids, can be formed from C, H, O, P, N, S in a \"one pot\" synthesis. This study can be regarded as a follow-up study of the classical Urey-Miller in vitro synthesis of biomolecules (Miller, 1953; Miller and Urey, 1959) .',\n",
       "  'Transition from the RNA to the DNA world was promoted by the formation of the reverse transcriptase. The enzyme was first described in retroviruses but it is almost ubiquitous and found in numerous cellular species, many of which with unknown functions (Simon and Zimmerly, 2008; Lescot et al., 2016) . It is an important link between the RNA and the DNA worlds. The name reverse transcriptase is historical and irritating because it is the \"real\" transcriptase during the transition from the RNA to the DNA world. Similarly, the ribonuclease H (RNase H) is an essential enzyme of retroviruses (Mölling et al., 1971) . The RNase H turned out to be one of the five most frequent and ancient proteins (Ma et al., 2008 ) that belongs to a superfamily of more than sixty different unique representatives and 152 families with numerous functions (Majorek et al., 2014) .Some of the many tRNAs can become loaded with amino acids.',\n",
       "  'There are viruses containing tRNA-like structures (TLS), resembling these early RNAs (Dreher, 2009) . The TLS of these viruses typically bind to a single amino acid. TLS-viruses include plant viruses, such as Turnip yellow mosaic virus, in Peanut clump virus, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and Brome mosaic virus. Only half a tRNA is found in Narnaviruses of fungi. The amino acids known to be components of tRNA-like viruses are valine, histidine and tyrosine. The structures were also designated as \"mimicry, \" enhancing translation (Dreher, 2009 (Dreher, , 2010 . They look like \"frozen\" precursor-like elements for protein synthesis. This combination of a partial tRNA linked to one amino acid can be interpreted as an evolutionary early step toward protein synthesis, trapped in a viral element.Ribozymes are related to the protein-free viroids. Viroids are virus-like elements that belong to the virosphere, the world of viruses (Chela-Flores, 1994) .',\n",
       "  'Viroids lack protein coats and therefore were initially not designated as viruses but virus-like viroids when they were discovered in 1971 by Theodor Diener. He described viroids as \"living fossils\" (Diener, 2016) (Figure 2) .From infected potatoes, Diener isolated the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) whose genome was about a 100-fold smaller than those of viruses known at that time. The viroids known today are ranging from 246 to 467 nucleotides. They contain circular single-stranded RNA, are protein-free and self-replicating with no genetic information, but only structural FIGURE 2 | Viroids are hairpin-loop structures and are shown schematically and as electron micrograph. Viroids are, like ribozymes, without genetic information and play major biological roles today in plant diseases, in carnation flowers, in liver cancer, as catalyst of protein synthesis in ribosomes and as circular regulatory RNAs, as \"sponges\" for other regulatory RNAs.information in the form of hairpin-loops (Riesner et al., 1979) .',\n",
       "  'They can generate copies of themselves in the appropriate environment. They were designated as the \"frontiers of life\" (Flores et al., 2014) .The knowledge of virus composition was based on TMV and its crystallization by Wendell Stanley in 1935 (Pennazio and Roggero, 2000) . The genome of TMV is protein-coding singlestranded RNA of about 6,400 nucleotides that is enclosed by a rod-like protein coat. Viroids, in contrast, do not encode proteins and lack coats but they are closely related to viruses. Viroids can lose their autonomy and rely on host RNA polymerases to replicate, are capable of infecting plants and many are economically important pathogens. There are two families, the nucleus-replicating Pospiviroidae such as PSTVd and the chloroplast-replicating Avsunviroidae like the Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd). Their replication requires host enzymes. Thus, autonomy is replaced by dependence on host enzymes and an intracellular lifestyle.Most viroids are often enzymatically active ribozymes -yet they are examples that this trait can get lost as a result of changing environmental conditions.',\n",
       "  'Loss of ribozyme activity is a functional, not a genetic loss. Only the nuclear variants, the Pospiviroidae, can lose their ribozyme activity and use the cellular RNase III enzyme for their replication. In contrast, the Avsunviroidae are still active hammerhead ribozymes. Thus, inside the nucleus of a host cell, the enzymatic RNA function can become unnecessary. Not genes, but a function, the catalytic activity, gets lost.Viroids did apparently not gain genes but cooperated for a more complex lifestyle. For example, Carnation small viroid-like RNA (CarSV RNA) cooperates with a retrovirus and is accompanied by a homologous DNA generated by a reverse transcriptase. This enzyme presumably originates from a pararetrovirus of plants. Pararetroviruses package virus particles at a different stage during replication than retroviruses, the DNA, not the RNA. This unique combination between two viral elements has so far only been detected with CarSV in carnation flowers (Flores et al., 2005 (Flores et al., , 2014 .',\n",
       "  'Why did such a cooperation evolve -perhaps by breeding gardeners? RNA is sensitive to degradation; therefore, genetic increase and growth of the genome may not be favorable energetically -at least not in plants. Gain of function is, in this case, cooperation.The circular RNA (circRNA) is related to ribozymes/viroids as a chief regulator of other regulatory RNAs, a \"sponge\" absorbing small RNAs. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that are affected by the presence of circRNAs. circRNAs were detected in human and mouse brains and testes as well as in plants. They can bind 70 conserved miRNAs in a cell and amount up to 25,000 molecules (Hansen et al., 2013) . Their structure is reminiscent of catalytically active ribozymes.There is an exceptional viroid that gained coding information and entered the human liver (Taylor, 2009) . The viroid is known as hepatitis delta virus (HDV).',\n",
       "  \"It has the smallest genome of any known animal virus of about 1,680 nucleotides. It has properties typical of viroids, since it contains circRNA, forms similar hairpin-loops and replicates in the nucleus using host enzymes. Two polymerases have to redirect their specificity from DNA to RNA to generate the HDV genome and antigenome. Both of them have ribozyme activity. In contrast to other ribozymes, HDV encodes a protein, the hepatitis delta antigen (HDVAg) that occurs in two forms, the small-HDVAg (24 kDa) supporting replication and the large-HDVAg (27 kDa) that helps virion assembly. The gene was presumably picked up from the host cell by recombination of HDV's mRNA intermediate with a host mRNA. Transmission depends on a helper virus, the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which delivers the coat (Taylor, 2009 ) Does packaging by a helper virus protect the genome and thereby allow for a larger viroid to exist?In plants, viroids may not be able to become bigger possibly due to their sensitivity to degradation -but they cannot become much smaller either.\",\n",
       "  'Only a single viroid is known that is completely composed of protein-coding RNA with triplets (AbouHaidar et al., 2014). Viroids and related replicating RNAs are error-prone replicating units and the error frequency imposes a certain minimal size onto them, as they would otherwise become extinct. This mechanism has been described as \"error catastrophe, \" which prevents survival (Eigen, 1971 (Eigen, , 2013 . The viroids and related RNAs are the smallest known replicons. Smaller ones would become extinct in the absence of repair systems.In summary, RNA can catalyze many reactions. Protein enzymes which may have evolved later have higher catalytic activities. Ribozymes are carriers of information, but do not require coding genes. Information is stored in their sequence and structure. Thus, replication of an initial RNA is followed by flow of information, from DNA to RNA to protein, as described the Central Dogma (Crick, 1968) .',\n",
       "  'Even an information flow from protein to DNA has been described for some archaeal proteins (Béguin et al., 2015) . The DNA-protein world contains numerous ncRNAs with key functions. ncRNA may serve as a model compound for the origin of life on other planets. Hereby not the chemical composition of this molecule is of prime relevance, but its simplicity and multifunctionality. Furthermore, RNA is software and hardware in a single molecule, which makes it unique in our world. There are other scenarios besides the here discussed \"virus-first, \" such as \"protein-first\", \"metabolism-fist\" or the \"lipid world\" (Segré et al., 2001; Andras and Andras, 2005; Vasas et al., 2010; Moelling, 2012) . Some of these alternative concepts were built on phylogenomics, the reconstruction of the tree of life by genome sequencing (Delsuc et al., 2005) . Surprisingly, it was Sir Francis Crick, one of the discoverers of the DNA double-helix, who stated that he would not be surprised about a world completely built of RNA.',\n",
       "  'A similar prediction was made by Walter Gilbert (Crick, 1968; Gilbert, 1986) . What a vision! Our world was almost 50 years later defined as \"RNAprotein\" world (Altman, 2013) . One can speculate our world was built of ribozymes or viroids, which means \"viruses first. \"ncRNAs appear as relics from the past RNA world, before DNA, the genetic code and proteins evolved. However, ncRNA is essential in our biological DNA world today. It is possible to produce such ncRNA today in the test tube by loss of genic information from protein-coding RNA. This reduction to ncRNA was demonstrated in vitro with phage RNA. Phage Qβ genomic RNA, 4,217 nucleotides in length, was incubated in the presence of Qβ replicase, free nucleotides and salts, a rich milieu in the test tube. The RNA was allowed to replicate by means of the Qβ replicase.',\n",
       "  'Serial transfer of aliquots to fresh medium led to ever faster replication rates and reduction of genomic size, down to 218 nucleotides of ncRNA in 74 generations. This study demonstrated that, depending on environmental conditions, an extreme gene reduction can take place. This experiment performed in 1965 was designated as \"Spiegelman\\'s Monster.\" Coding RNA became replicating ncRNA (Spiegelman et al., 1965; Kacian et al., 1972) ! Manfred Eigen extended this experiment and demonstrated further that a mixture containing no RNA to start with but only ribonucleotides and the Qβ replicase can under the right conditions in a test tube spontaneously generate self-replicating ncRNA. This evolved into a form similar to Spiegelman\\'s Monster. The presence of the replicase enzyme was still necessary in these studies. Furthermore, a change in enzyme concentration and addition of short RNAs or an RNA intercalator influenced the arising RNA population (Sumper and Luce, 1975; Eigen, 2013) .',\n",
       "  'Thus, the complexity of genomes depends on the environment: poor conditions lead to increased complexity and rich environments to reduced complexity.The process demonstrated in this experiment with viral components indicates that reversion to simplicity, reduction in size, loss of genetic information and speed in replication can be major forces of life, even though this appears to be like a reversion of evolution. The experiment can perhaps be generalized from the test tube to a principle, that the most successful survivors on our planet are the viruses and microorganisms, which became the most abundant entities. Perhaps life can start from there again.These studies raise the question of how RNA molecules can become longer, if the small polymers become smaller and smaller, replicate faster and outcompete longer ones. This may be overcome by heat flow across an open pore in submerged rocks, which concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selection for longer strands.',\n",
       "  'This has been described for an increase from 100 to 1,000 nucleotides in vitro. RNA molecules shorter than 75 nucleotides will die out (Kreysing et al., 2015) . Could a poor environment lead to an increase of complexity? This could be tested. Ribozymes were shown to grow in size by uptake of genes, as demonstrated for HDV (Taylor, 2009 ).An interesting recent unexpected example supporting the notion that environmental conditions influence genetic complexity, is the human gut microbiome. Its complexity increases with diverse food, while uniform rich food reduces its diversity and may lead to diseases such as obesity. Colonization of the human intestinal tract starts at birth. A few dozen bacterial and viral/phage species are conserved between individuals (core sequences) as a stable composition (Broecker et al., 2016c . Dysbiosis has been observed in several chronic diseases and in obesity, a loss of bacterial richness and diversity.',\n",
       "  \"Nutrition under affluent conditions with sugar-rich food contributes to obesity, which results in a significant reduction of the complexity of the microbiome. This reduction is difficult to revert (Cotillard et al., 2013; Le Chatelier et al., 2013) . The gut microbiome in human patients with obesity is reminiscent of the gene reduction described in the Spiegelman's Monster experiment: reduction of genes in a rich environment.The reduction of the complexity of the microbiome is in part attributed to the action of phages, which under such conditions, defined as stress, lyse the bacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation can even be replaced by soluble fractions containing phages or metabolites from the donor without bacteria (Ott et al., 2017) . Analogously, the most highly complex microbiomes are found in indigenous human tribes in Africa, which live on a broad variety of different nutrients. It is a slow process, though, to increase gut microbiota complexity by diverse nutrition.\",\n",
       "  'The obesity-associated microbiota that survive are fitter and more difficult to counteract. Urbanization and westernization of the diet is associated with a loss of microbial biodiversity, loss of microbial organisms and genes (Segata, 2015) .To understand the mechanism and driving force for genome reduction, deletion rates were tested by insertion of an indicator gene into the Salmonella enterica genome. The loss of the indicator gene was monitored by serial passage in rich medium. After 1,000 generations about 25% of the deletions caused increased bacterial fitness. Deletions resulted in smaller genomes with reduced or absence of DNA repair genes (Koskiniemi et al., 2012) . Gene loss conferred a higher fitness to the bacteria under these experimental conditions.The recently discovered mimiviruses and other giant viruses are worth considering for understanding the evolution of life with respect to the contribution of viruses. Their hosts are, for example, Acanthamoeba, Chlorella, and Coccolithus algae (Emiliania huxleyi), but also corals or sponges as discussed more recently.',\n",
       "  'Mimiviruses were first discovered in cooling water towers in Bradford, United Kingdom in 2003 with about 1,000 genes, most of which unrelated to previously known genes. Mimiviruses have received attention because they contain elements that were considered hallmarks of living cells, not of viruses, such as elements required for protein synthesis, tRNAs and amino acid transferases. The mimiviruses harbor these building blocks as incomplete sets not sufficient for independent protein synthesis as bacteria or archaea can perform, preventing them from leading an autonomous life (La Scola et al., 2003 Scola et al., , 2008 . They are larger than some bacteria. Giant viruses can be looked at as being on an evolutionary path toward a cellular organism. Alternatively, they may have evolved from a cellular organism by loss of genetic information (Nasir and Caetano-Anolles, 2015) .',\n",

A graph on genome sizes shows that mimiviruses and bacteria overlap in size, indicating a continuous transition between viruses and bacteria and between living and non-living worlds (based on Holmes, 2011) (Figure 3) . Other giant viruses, such as megaviruses, were discovered in the ocean of Chile with 1,120 genes. Most recently the Klosneuvirus was identified in the sewage of the monastery Klosterneuburg in Austria in 2017 with 1.57 million (mio) basepairs (Mitch, 2017) . Pithovirus sibericum is the largest among giant viruses discovered to date with a diameter of 1.5 microns, a genome of 470,000 bp with 467 putative genes, 1.6 microns in length, and it is presumably 30,000 years old as it was recovered from permafrost in Siberia (Legendre et al., 2014) .',\n",

These virophages such as Sputnik are only 50 nm in size with 18,343 bp of circular dsDNA and 21 predicted proteincoding genes. They replicate in viral factories and consume the resources of the mimivirus, thereby destroying it. Some, virophages can even integrate into the genome of the cellular host and can be reactivated when the host is infected by giant viruses. Thus, giant viruses suggest that viruses are close to living entities or may have been alive (La Scola et al., 2008; Fischer and Hackl, 2016) . In biology it is common to distinguish between living and dead matter by the ability to synthesize proteins and replicate autonomously.',\n",

The transition from living to the non-living world is continuous, not separated by a sharp borderline (Figure 3) .Viruses are not considered alive by most of the scientific community and as written in textbooks, because they cannot replicate autonomously. Yet some of the giant viruses are equipped with almost all components of the protein synthesis machinery close to bacteria suggesting that they belong to the living matter (Schulz et al., 2017) . The ribozymes may have been the earliest replicating entity. Perhaps also other viruses were initially more independent of the early Earth than they are today. As described in Figure 1 there may have been initially no major difference between an early virus or an early cell.',\n",

It is an alpha-proteobacterium with 1,389 genes present ubiquitously in all oceans. It can reach up to 10 28 free living cells in total and represents about 25% of microbial plankton cells. Very little of its DNA is non-coding. It harbors podophage-type phages, designated as \"pelagiphage\" (Zhao et al., 2013) .

Viruses also occur freely in the oceans, in the soil, in clouds up to the stratosphere and higher, to at least 300 km in altitude. They populate the human intestine, birth canal, and the outside of the body as protective layer against microbial populations. Microbes contain phages that are activated during stress conditions such as lack of nutrients, change in temperatures, lack of space and other changes of environmental conditions.One of the most earth-shaking papers of this century was the publication of the human genome sequence (Lander et al., 2001) .',\n",

The origin of REs is being discussed as remnants of ancient retroviral germline infections that became evolutionarily fixed in the genome. About 450,000 human ERV (HERV) elements constitute about 8% of the human genome consisting of hallmark retroviral elements like the gag, pol, env genes and flanking long terminal repeats (LTR) that act as promoters (Lander et al., 2001) .

In some genes such as the Protein Kinase Inhibitor B (PKIB) gene we determined about 70% retrovirusrelated sequences (Moelling and Broecker, 2015) . Is there a limit? Could it have been 100%? Retroviruses are estimated to have entered the lineage of the mammalian genome 550 million years ago (MYA) (Hayward, 2017) . Older ERV sequences may exist but are unrecognizable today due to the accumulation of mutations.ERVs undergo mutations, deletions or homologous recombination events with large deletions and can become as short as solo LTR elements, which are a few hundred bp in length -the left-overs from full-length retroviral genomes of about 10,000 bp. The LTR promoters can deregulate neighboring genes. Homologous recombination events may be considered as gene loss or gene reduction events.',\n",
       "  'It is the assumption that the ERVs, which were no longer needed for host cell defense, were no longer selected for by evolution and consequently deleted as unnecessary consumers of energy.Eugene Koonin points out that infection and integration are unique events occurring at a fast pace, while loss and gene reduction may take much longer time frames (Wolf and Koonin, 2013) .A frequent gene reduction of eukaryotic genomes is the loss of the viral envelope protein encoded by the env gene. Without a coat, retroviruses can no longer leave the cell and infect other cells. They lose mobility and become obligatory intracellular elements. Helper viruses can supply envelope proteins in trans and mobilize the viruses. TEs or REs can be regarded as examples of coat-free intracellular virus relics -or could it have been the other way round, perhaps precursors of full-length retroviruses?These elements can be amplified intracellularly and modify the host genomes by integration with the potential danger of gene disruption and genetic changes.',\n",
       "  'REs can lead to gene duplications and pseudogene development, with one copy for stable conservation of acquired functions and the other one for innovations (Cotton and Page, 2005) . Such duplications constitute large amounts of mammalian genomes (Zhang, 2003) . Retroviruses have an RNase H moiety duplication, one of which serves as a catalytically inactive linker between the RT polymerase and the enzymatically active RNase H (Xiong and Eickbush, 1990; Malik and Eickbush, 2001; Moelling and Broecker, 2015; Moelling et al., 2017) . This gene duplication dates back to 500 mio years (Cotton and Page, 2005) .Gene duplications are a common cause of cancer, which often occurs only in the genome of the cancer cell itself, less affecting offsprings. Myc, Myb, ErbB2, Ras, and Raf are oncogenes amplified in diverse types of human cancers (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2002) . The ability of retroviruses to integrate makes them distinct from endosymbionts which stay separate.',\n",
       "  'Yet the net result is very similar, acquisition of new genetic information, which is transmitted to the next generation, if the germline is infected and endogenization of the virus occurred.Viral integration is not limited to eukaryotic cells but also a mechanism in prokaryotes for maintenance of the lysogenic state of phages inside bacteria.Also, for other eukaryotic viruses such as HBV, the envelope surface antigen BHsAg can be deleted, which leads to an obligatory intracellular life style for the virus, which especially in the presence of HCV promotes cancer (Yang et al., 2016) .HIV has been shown to rapidly lose one of its auxiliary genes, nef, originally for negative factor. The gene was lost within a rather low number of passages of the virus grown under tissue culture conditions by selection for high virus titer producing cells. Deletion of nef resulted in a significant increase of the virus titer in culture -hence the name.',\n",
       "  'The nef gene product was of no need inside tissue culture cells, rather it was inhibitory for replication. However, it is essential for pathogenicity in animals, and subsequently nef was reinterpreted as \"necessary factor\" (Flint, 2015) .Also, the human hosts of HIV can lose a significant terminal portion of a seven transmembrane receptor in lymphocytes, the primary target cell for HIV entry and for virus uptake. This molecule, the CCR5 cytokine receptor is truncated by 32 carboxy-terminal amino acids (CCR5-32), disabling the receptor functionally. The allele frequency of the mutant CCR5-32 mutant is about 10% in the European population, making these people resistant to HIV infections (Solloch et al., 2017) . This gene loss in Europeans has been shown to make the individuals resistant not only against HIV infection but also against malaria. This may have been the selective pressure in the past before HIV/AIDS arose.',\n",
       "  'No side effect for humans lacking this gene has been described (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003) .Viruses have been proven to be drivers of evolution (Villarreal and Witzany, 2010) , including the human genome, which by at least 45% is composed of sequences related to retroviruses. In addition, endogenized retroviruses supplied the syncytin genes that are essential for the development of the mammalian placenta, and allowed the growth of embryos without its rejection by the maternal immune system (Dupressoir et al., 2012) . Thus, the same property which causes immunodeficiency in HIV-infected patients and leads to AIDS causes syncytia formation, cell fusion after infection by a retrovirus. Viruses have also been proposed to be at the origin of the evolution of adaptive immunity (Villarreal, 2009 ). Thus, viruses shaped genomes by supplying essential genes and mechanisms.Endogenization of retroviruses has occurred in the mammalian genomes for at least 550 mio years (Hayward, 2017) .',\n",
       "  'If the integrated ERVs did not provide any selective advantage, they deteriorated and accumulated mutations with loss of function. This was directly proven by reconstruction of an infectious retrovirus from the consensus sequence of 9 defective endogenous virus sequences, designated as Phoenix. The virus was expressed from a constructed synthetic DNA clone in cell culture and formed virus particles identified by high resolution microscopic analysis (Dewannieux and Heidmann, 2013) .The koalas in Australia are currently undergoing endogenization of a retrovirus (koala retrovirus, KoRV) in \"real time\" and demonstrate possible consequences for immunity. In the early 1900s, some individuals were transferred to islands, including Kangaroo Island, close to the Australian mainland for repopulation purposes, as koalas were threatened to become extinct. Today, the majority of the koala population is infected by KoRV, which is closely related to the Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV).',\n",
       "  'Yet, koalas isolated on Kangaroo Island are KoRV negative, which allows dating the introduction of KoRV into the koala population to about one hundred years ago. Many of the infected koalas fell ill and died, yet some populations became resistant within about 100 years, corresponding to about 10 generations. The koalas likely developed resistance due to the integrated DNA proviruses. The retrovirus is transmitted as exogenous as well as endogenous virus, similar to the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), whereby the endogenized viruses protect with a viral gene product, such as Env, against de novo infections by \"superinfection exclusion\" (Tarlinton, 2012) . The contribution of retroviruses to the antiviral defense is striking, since all retroviral genes have analogous genes in the siRNA/RNAi defense mechanism of eukaryotic cells (Moelling et al., 2006) .Retroviruses can protect against infection by other related viruses, for example, by expressing Env proteins that block cellsurface receptors (Villarreal, 2011) .',\n",
       "  'A comparable mechanism protects bacterial cells against DNA phages, by integrated phage DNA fragments that are transcribed into mRNA and hybridize to incoming new DNA phages and thereby lead to their destruction by hybrid-specific nucleases, CRISPR/Cas immunity (Charpentier and Doudna, 2013) . It is often not realized that immunity acquisition in bacteria and mammalian cells follow analogous mechanisms (Figure 4) .Integration of retroviruses normally occurs in somatic cells after infection as an obligatory step during the viral life cycle. Infection of germline cells can lead to transmission to the next generation and ultimately result in inherited resistance. Endogenized retroviruses likely caused resistance FIGURE 4 | Viruses protect against viruses: retroviruses protect a cell against a new infection by a similar virus designated as \"superinfection exclusion\" or viral interference. This is mediated by viral gene products such as proteins or nucleic acids. Similarly, phages protect against phages: superinfection of bacteria is prevented by CRISPR/Cas RNA originating from previous infections.',\n",
       "  'The mechanisms of defense against viruses and phages are analogous. Protection by viruses or phages against superinfections represents cellular defense and acquired immunity. The four examples are discussed in the text.to the exogenous counterparts. Similarly, resistance to Simian Immune Deficiency virus (SIV) in some monkey species may be explained by endogenization (Li et al., 2017 (Li et al., , 2018 . In the case of phages and their prokaryotic hosts the mechanism is described as CRISPR/Cas, which follow analogous principles of \"endogenization\" of incoming genetic material for subsequent exclusion.One may speculate that HIV may also eventually become endogenized into the human genome. There is some evidence that HIV can infect human germline cells and can be transmitted to the embryonic genome (Wang et al., 2011) . How long this may take is not known -10 generations?The loss of function of ERVs can occur by mutations, deletions of the env or other genes and ultimately all coding genes by homologous recombination, leaving behind only one LTR.',\n",
       "  'The number of retrovirus-like elements add up to about 450,000, corresponding to 8% of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001; Cordaux and Batzer, 2009 ). The promoter regions were analyzed for their contribution to cancer by activating neighboring genes -as a consequence of a former retrovirus infection. Indeed, activated cellular genes by \"downstream promotion\" were identified in animal studies with activation of the myc gene as one of many examples, leading to chronic, not acute development of cancer (Ott et al., 2013) . As a general mechanism for human cancer today the LTRs are, however, not identified as a major culprit. Most of the ERVs we find today have been integrated during evolution in introns or other regions where their presence is relatively harmless. Did the other ones result in death of the carriers which disappeared?',\n",
       "  'The effects of LTRs on the expression levels of neighboring host genes was studied with the endogenous human virus, HERV-K, as a possible cause of cancer, but this appears not to be a general phenomenon (Broecker et al., 2016b) . As shown for the koalas, ERVs can confer immunity to viral infections (Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012) .A related ERV, HERV-H, was shown to produce an RNA that keeps early embryonic cells pluripotent and even revert adult cells to regain pluripotency (Grow et al., 2015) . Thus, the role of ERVs may be more complex than we presently know.Transposable elements and REs that lost the ability of cellular transmission by deletion of the coat protein majorly contribute to genetic complexity of host cells. They are \"locked\" inside the cells and are major drivers of the increase of genetic complexity (Cordaux and Batzer, 2009 ).',\n",
       "  'One could speculate that these intracellular elements are replicationincompetent retroviruses lacking coats (Lander et al., 2001) . Bats transmit viruses such as Ebola and SARS coronavirus without suffering from disease (Beltz, 2018) . Even RNA viruses such as Bornaviruses have been shown to integrate by illegitimate reverse transcription, possibly also supplying immunity against superinfection (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) .There are two prominent events that significantly contributed to the success of life and the formation of cells. Both of them are associated with gene reduction. This phenomenon may play a role for the evolution of viruses from autonomous to parasitic lifestyles. In the 1960s Lynn Margulis proposed an extracellular origin for mitochondria (Margulis, 1970 (Margulis, , 1993 ). An ancestral cell, perhaps an archaeon, was infected by an anaerobic bacterium, which gave rise to mitochondria. Similarly, cyanobacteria formed the chloroplasts in modern plant cells. Mitochondria arose around 1.45 billion years ago (BYA) (Embley and Martin, 2006) .',\n",
       "  'Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the most striking examples for a change in lifestyle from autonomous bacteria to endosymbionts. This transition is often considered as extremely rare and a hallmark of evolution of life on our planet. However, there are many other obligate intracellular parasites such as Rickettsia, Chlamydia trachomatis, Coxiella burnetii (the causative agent of Q fever), Mycobacterium leprae, M. tuberculosis, and M. mycoides (Beare et al., 2006) .The change of lifestyle of the endosymbionts in the two cases of mitochondria and chloroplasts is striking. Both of them drastically reduced their genetic make-up. Mitochondria contain less than 37 genes, left from the original about 3,000 genes. Is endogenization of retroviruses, the ERVs, which are integrated into germline cells, related to endosymbiosis? Are these endosymbionts models for the transition from autonomous lifestyle to a parasitic life-which may have taken place with viruses? A more recent typical example for a reductive evolution are Rickettsia.',\n",
       "  'These bacteria were assumed for some time to be viruses because of their obligatory intracellular parasitic existence. Rickettsia have evolved from autonomously replicating bacteria. Reductive evolution of endosymbionts can yield bacteria with tiny genomes on the expense of autonomous extracellular life. Their genomes are 1.11 mio bp in length with about 834 protein-coding genes, and loss of 24% by reductive evolution (Ogata et al., 2001) . Rickettsia may have some relationship with cyanobacteria, which are considered as the major symbionts.Can one speculate that viruses may have been autonomous entities initially? Viroids may have undergone transition from autonomy to parasites, just as shown for mitochondria, chloroplasts or Rickettsia? To which extent have viruses been autonomous and independent of cellular metabolisms originally -and contributed to the origin of cells? Could they only later have lost their autonomy and become parasitic?Viruses are minimalistic in their composition and must have undergone stringent gene reductions (Flint, 2015) .',\n",
       "  'How small can their genomes become? Most coding RNA viruses still contain regulatory elements, ncRNA at the 3 and 5 terminal regions for ribosomal entry, protein synthesis, transcriptional regulation, and others.A subgroup of retroviruses is an interesting example in respect to simultaneous loss and gain of genetic information. The oncogenic retroviruses or tumorviruses can recombine with cellular genes which under the promoters of retroviruses can become oncogenes and drivers of cancer. About a hundred oncogenes have been selected for in the laboratories and studied over decades for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer. Selection for growth advantages of the host cells led to the discovery of the fastest growth-promoting oncogenes we know today, such as Ras, Raf, ErbB or Myc, which are in part successful targets for anticancer drugs (Moelling et al., 1984) .These oncogenes were in most cases taken up by the retroviruses at the expense of structural (gag), replicating (pol) or envelope (env) genes, and are often expressed as fusion proteins with Gag.',\n",
       "  'Thus, oncogenic retroviruses are obligatory intracellular defective viruses and were selected for in the laboratory by researchers for the oncogenes with the most potent growth promoting ability. They need the supply of replicatory genes in trans from co-infecting helper viruses to infect other cells (Flint, 2015) . Retroviruses are able to pick up cellular genes, transfer and integrate them into neighboring cells. Some strains of Rous sarcoma virus maintain replication competent when carrying the cell-derived src (for sarcoma) oncogene encoding a protein of 536 amino acids that apparently can fit into the retroviral particle along with the full-size viral genome (Broecker et al., 2016a) . Spatial reasons may have influenced the formation of oncogenic retroviruses and limited their size and thereby led to their defective phenotypes.There are indications that the uncontrolled activity of (retro)transposons in germline cells can result in diseases such as male infertility -presumably by \"error catastrophe, \" caused by too many transposition events.',\n",
       "  'In mammals, piRNAs tame transposon activity by means of the RNase H activity of PIWI proteins during spermatogenesis (Girard et al., 2006) .Only a minority of viruses are pathogens; most of them do not cause diseases. On the contrary, they are most important as drivers of evolution, as transmitters of genetic material, as innovative agents. In particular, the RNA viruses are the most innovative ones. Some of them are pathogenic and dangerous, such as HIV or influenza virus, or viroids in plants. RNA viruses are able to change so rapidly that the host immune system is unable to counteract the infection. Pathogenicity arises when environmental conditions change, for instance, when a virus enters a new organism or species.Increase of cellular complexity by viruses is an important feature of evolution. Such major evolutionary changes are recently taken as arguments against the evolutionary theory by Charles Darwin who considered gradual changes, small increments by mutations as the main basis for selection and evolution.',\n",
       "  \"New criticism is addressing this thinking, considering larger changes as evolutionary drivers. Such changes arise by many complex phenomena such as endosymbiosis, infection by prokaryotes, viruses and fungi, recombination of genes, HGT, infections, sex. Dramatic changes such as endosymbiosis or pathogen infections extend Darwin's concept of evolution.There are numerous examples for the contribution of viruses to the evolution of life since at least as long as 550 MYA (Hayward, 2017) . But genetic noise through random mutations does not allow us to go back to the origin of life. It may not be impossible that the earliest compartment was indistinguishable, either a pre-cell or a pre-virus. By analogy one may speculate that at some point autonomous viruses gave up independence for an obligatory intracellular life -as has been described for mitochondria and chloroplasts but also intracellular bacteria such as Rickettsia.\",\n",
       "  'This speculation is based on the concept that early life must have started simple and with high genetic variability and then became more complex. But complexity can be given up for a less energy consuming lifestyle with small genomes and high speed of replication (Moelling, 2012 (Moelling, , 2013 . Therefore, the question may be repeated: \"Are viruses our oldest ancestors?\" Some fossil life can be partially reproduced in vitro by Spiegelman\\'s Monster and Eigen\\'s follow-up experiments, explaining the great surviving potential of simple ncRNA.Viruses can be pathogens, but their recognition as primarily causing diseases is wrong. This notion is based on the history of viruses in medicine, as explained in a book entitled \"Viruses: More Friends Than Foes\" (Moelling, 2017) . The scenario described here focuses on viruses as drivers of evolution.The early RNA world gained interest 20-30 years ago as evidenced by the references provided above.',\n",
       "  'Surprisingly, there are scientists who still believe in the \"pansperm hypothesis\" and think that retroviruses are of extraterrestric origin (Steele et al., 2018) . The recent interest in the origin of life arose from the newly discovered exoplanets whose number increases daily -and which may be as numerous as 10 25 . Thus, pure statistics make some people believe that there is extraterrestrial life.The extraterrestric life is mimicked in laboratories on Earth with many assumptions -perhaps this overview stimulates some thinking. The discussion presented here should be taken as concept about simple replicating and evolving entities possibly arising from different building blocks in other environments, with structure being more relevant than sequence.'],\n",
       " ['Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-borne emerging pathogen that has a major health impact in humans and causes fever disease, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia. Indigenous to tropical Africa, recent large outbreaks have been reported in parts of South East Asia and several of its neighboring islands in 2005–07 and in Europe in 2007. Furthermore, positive cases have been confirmed in the United States in travelers returning from known outbreak areas. Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment. With the threat of an emerging global pandemic, the peculiar problems associated with the more immediate and seasonal epidemics warrant the development of an effective vaccine. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting these concepts.Text: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne pathogen listed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as a Category C Priority Pathogen that causes Chikungunya fever (CHIKF), has been spreading throughout Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe in recent times [1, 2, 3] .',\n",
       "  \"CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) and is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti, the infamous yellow fever propagator [4, 5] . CHIKV infection is marked by severe joint pain, contorting its victims into unusual postures  . The disease gets its name from the Kimakonde vernacular language of Tanzania and Mozambique, and the word chikungunya means ''that which contorts or bends up'' and translates in Swahili to ''the illness of the bended walker'' [7, 8, 9] . In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in a sylvatic cycle among forest-dwelling Aedes spp. mosquitoes, wild primates, squirrels, birds, and rodents ( Figure 1 )  . In Asia, the disease is vectored by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus  . Transmission in Asia occurs in an urban cycle whereby the mosquito spreads the disease from an infected human to an uninfected human, following an epidemiological pattern similar to dengue fever  .The 2005-2006 epidemic of CHIKV in La Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean, spurred the discovery of a new vector species, Ae.\",\n",

Wrecking over one-third of the island's population, this epidemic peaked its devastation between January and February 2006, when over 46,000 cases came into light every week, including 284 deaths [5, 13] . Ae. albopictus is common in urban areas of the United States and is already flourishing in 36 states, raising grave concerns to the immunologically naive populace of the United States  .Accordingly, this review elaborately details the epidemiology and global expansion of CHIKV, describes its clinical features and pathogenesis and its symptoms and complications, and finally nominates a possible vaccine approach against CHIKV infection.CHIKV has been isolated into three genotypes based on phylogenetic studies. These genotypes, based on the gene sequences of an Envelope protein (E1), are Asian, East/Central/ South African, and West African [4, 11, 15] . Using phylogenetic models, Cherian et al.\",\n",
       "  'estimate that the Asian genotype of CHIKV emerged between 50 and 310 y ago, and the West and East African genotypes diverged between 100 and 840 y ago  . Since then, CHIKV has come a long way, with several mutations incorporated, and has continued to wreak epidemics in several regions. Recent activities of CHIKV include the Indian epidemic in 2005-2006, which was followed by a sudden explosion of cases in 2007. An estimated 1.3 million people across 13 states were reported to be infected in India [12, 16] , and CHIKV was also widespread in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia  . In July-August of 2007, CHIKV was reported in Italy, probably brought in by travelers from CHIKV-prone regions of India, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius, Madagascar, and Seychelles.',\n",
       "  'Few of the Italian isolates were found to have evolved from the Kerala isolate, which was associated with a A226V shift in E1 gene that represents a successful evolutionary adaptation in the mosquito vector similar to the ones observed in Reunion Island [2, 18, 19] .In recent times, with an increase in global travel, the risk for spreading CHIKV to non-endemic regions has heightened  . Several travelers have brought CHIKV home with them after visiting areas with actively infected populations [12, 20] . Such cases have been documented in European countries, Australia, Asia, and the United States [8, 21] . The United States has already reported at least twelve cases of travel-associated CHIKV, while France has reported 850 cases, and the United Kingdom 93 [8, 14] . Beyond this, CHIKV-infected travelers have also been diagnosed in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, French Guiana, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Martinique, Norway, Switzerland, and Sri Lanka  .',\n",
       "  'Some travelers were viremic, worrying public health officials about the spread of CHIKV to new areas [1, 8] .The incubation time for CHIKV is relatively short, requiring only 2-6 d with symptoms usually appearing 4-7 d post-infection  . Vazeille et al. detected CHIKV in the salivary glands of Ae. albopictus only 2 d after infection  . Upon infection, CHIKF tends to present itself in two phases. The first stage is acute, while the second stage, experienced by most but not all, is persistent, causing disabling polyarthritis. Characteristics of the acute phase include an abrupt onset of fever, arthralgia, and in some cases, maculopapular rash [6, 23] . The acute phase causes such intense joint and muscular pain that makes movement very difficult and prostrates its victims [6, 20] .Ninety-five percent of infected adults are symptomatic after infection, and of these, most become disabled for weeks to months as a result of decreased dexterity, loss of mobility, and delayed reaction.',\n",
       "  'Eighteen months after disease onset, 40% of patients are found to still have anti-CHIKV IgM [6, 18, 23, 24] . The chronic stage of CHIKF is characterized by polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage  . CHIKV has been shown to attack fibroblasts, explaining the involvement of muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. The high number of nociceptive nerve endings found within the joints and muscle connective tissues can explain pain associated with CHIKF [25, 26] .More than 50% of patients who suffer from severe CHIKF are over 65 y old, and more than 33% of them die. Most adults who suffer from severe CHIKF have underlying medical conditions [6, 24, 27] . The other group that is disproportionately affected by severe CHIKV is children.',\n",

For instance, Ae. aegypti, responsible for epidemics in Kenya, Comoros, and Seychelles, carried CHIKV with an alanine in the 226 position of the E1 gene (E1-A226) [4, 18] . However, when the virus struck La Reunion Islands, a decline in population of Ae. aegypti, due to massive dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane usage and dearth of Ae. albopictus species' www.plosntds.org population, resulted in an ecological pressure, favoring replacement of alanine at position 226 with valine (E1-A226V)  . This mutation allowed CHIKV's secondary vector species, Ae. albopictus, to supplement Ae.\",\n",

All of the CHIKV strains isolated from Mayotte carried the E1-A226V mutation, and the mutation was also found in Madagascar in 2007  . The E1-A226V mutation was not present at the beginning of the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak (before September 2005). However, more than 90% of later viral strains found there had incorporated the mutation (December-March 2006), indicating a genotype switch during the winter season [5, 18, 20] .The E1-A226V mutation also enabled an increase in infectivity of Ae. albopictus when compared to its infectivity of Ae. aegypti [4, 11, 18, 30] , and with several factors taken together, Ae. albopictus has become the new preferred and more lethal vector for CHIKV [4, 5, 11] .\",\n",
       "  'In fact, Tsetsarkin et al. found that a Green Fluorescent Protein tagged E1-A226V virus was 100 times more infective to Ae. albopictus than it was to Ae. aegypti  . In all the Indian Ocean Islands, Ae. albopictus became the main vector for CHIKV within 1-2 y after CHIKV was introduced to the region  .Of note is that Ae. aegypti has most likely been established in North America for over 300 y, while Ae. albopictus has been in many areas of the US, since 1985, primarily in Florida  and since then has expanded its range in the country. Reiskind et al. set out to determine if Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes captured in Florida were susceptible to CHIKV infection by a La Reunion isolate  . Each mosquito tested was highly susceptible to infection by a full-length infectious clone of the La Réunion Island isolate, CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain.',\n",
       "  \"Even though the Ae. albopictus strains were more susceptible to infection, overall ecology and differences in human biting patterns need to be studied further Characteristically, there are two rounds of translation: (+) sense genomic RNA (49S9 = 11.7 kb) acts directly as mRNA and is partially translated (59 end) to produce non-structural proteins (nsp's). These proteins are responsible for replication and formation of a complementary (2) strand, the template for further (+) strand synthesis. Subgenomic mRNA (26 S = 4.1 kb) replication occurs through the synthesis of full-length (2) intermediate RNA, which is regulated by nsp4 and p123 precursor in early infection and later by mature nsp's. Translation of the newly synthesized sub-genomic RNA results in production of structural proteins such as Capsid and protein E2-6k-E1 (from 39 end of genome). Assembly occurs at the cell surface, and the envelope is acquired as the virus buds from the cell and release and maturation almost simultaneous occurred.\",\n",

However, about 50% of newborns delivered while the mother was infected with CHIKV contracted the disease from their mother, despite the method of delivery. Furthermore, there have been instances of CHIKV transmission from mother to fetus causing congenital illness and fetal death  .During the 2005-2006 La Reunion Island outbreaks, Ramful et al. discovered that mothers could transmit CHIKV to their progeny during the perinatal period (Day 24 to Day +1) [33, 34] , and it is associated with a high degree of morbidity. By mean Day 4 of life, all of the neonates were symptomatic for CHIKV, exhibiting common CHIKF symptoms.',\n",

Of those mothers who, during the La Reunion Island epidemic, were infected long before delivery, only three fetal deaths were reported [12, 33] . Ramful et al. theorized that motherto-child transmission most likely happens transplacentally shortly before delivery  . A similar study by Gerardin et al. reported nineteen cases of neonatal infection associated with intrapartum maternal viremia that progressed to develop encephalitis owing to vertical transmission from infected mothers  .Clinical and epidemiological similarities with dengue fever make CHIKV diagnosis difficult, which may lead physicians to misdiagnose CHIKV as dengue fever; therefore, the incidence of CHIKV may actually be higher than currently believed (Table 1 ) [6, 12, 35] .The amount of time elapsed since disease onset is the most critical parameter when choosing a diagnostic test. CHIKV can be detected and isolated by culturing with mosquito cells (C6/36), Vero cells (mammalian), or in mice  .',\n",
       "  'However, this method can take at least a week and only achieves a high sensitivity during the viremic phase, which usually only lasts up to 48 h after the bite. Five days post-infection, the viral isolation approach has a low sensitivity but is still the preferred method for detecting the CHIKV strain [12, 26, 31, 35] . RT-PCR on the other hand is a faster and more sensitive method that can be used within the first week of disease onset  , and it is currently the most sensitive method for detecting and quantifying viral mRNA [4, 36] .Classic serological detection, by assays such as ELISA  , immunofluorescence [5, 38] , complement binding, and haemagglutination inhibition  , constitutes the second diagnostic tool used for biological diagnosis of CHIKV infection. These proven techniques are useful for detection of Antigen in mosquitoes during epidemiological studies.',\n",
       "  'These assays detect virus-specific IgM and IgG, however the sensitivity and specificity of these assays has been poorly characterized. Viral competence, or the potential of viral infection and transmission, is an important parameter that can be quantified by ELISA, viral culture, and PCR.A study by Ng et al. showed biomarkers indicative of severe CHIKV infection  . They found decreased levels of RANTES and increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) that could be sued for CHIKV detection in patients as indicators of CHIKV-driven cytokine storm. Couderc et al. demonstrate another cytokine, type-I IFN, as a key player in the progression to CHIKV infection  . Using an IFN-a/b null mouse model, they demonstrated evidence of muscles, joints, and skin as privileged CHIKV targets, which is consistent with human pathology. Although Ng et al. concluded that RANTES levels were significantly suppressed in severe CHIKF patients  , interestingly, an increase in levels of RANTES has been observed in dengue infection  .',\n",
       "  'Since the symptoms of CHIKF mimic those of dengue fever, results obtained from this study strongly suggest that RANTES could be a potential distinctive biomarker that differentiates between these two clinically similar diseases.There are no approved antiviral treatments currently available for CHIKV [1, 3, 12, 42] . Currently, CHIKF is treated symptomatically, usually with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids, bed rest, and fluids. Movement and mild exercise are thought to decrease stiffness and morning arthralgia, but heavy exercise may exacerbate rheumatic symptoms. Corticosteroids may be used in cases of debilitating chronic CHIKV infection. There is a debate about the appropriateness of chloroquine as treatment for unresolved, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugresistant arthritis  . A study showed that viral production was www.plosntds.org drastically reduced at 16 h post-infection after treatment with 100 mM dec-RVKR-cmk (Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone), a furine inhibitor [42, 44] . Chloroquine acted by raising the pH, blocking low pH-dependent entry of virus into the cell.',\n",
       "  'It is important to note that dec-RVKR-cmk or chloroquine only inhibited viral spreading from cell to cell, not CHIKV replication once it had entered the cell  . However, most would agree that the best weapon against CHIKV is prevention. A live CHIKV vaccine developed by the United States reached phase II clinical trial encompassing 59 healthy volunteers  . Eight percent of the volunteers experienced transient arthralgia, while 98% of the volunteers had seroconversion  . However, live CHIKV vaccines are still questionable. One cannot discount the risk of a live vaccine possibly inducing chronic rheumatism. Also, there is the question as to whether widespread use among the public could trigger mosquito transmission or lead to chronic infection or viral reversion  .An alternative approach would be to produce a chimeric vaccine against CHIKV. Wang et al. developed a chimeric alphavirus vaccine that is uniformly attenuated and does not cause reactogenicity in mice  .',\n",
       "  'Three different versions of this vaccine were made using three different backbone vectors: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) attenuated vaccine strain T-83, naturally attenuated eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and attenuated Sindbis virus (SINV). In short, CHIKV structural proteins were engineered into the backbones of the aforementioned vaccines to produce the chimeras  . These chimeras were found to stimulate a strong humoral immunity, and even at doses of 5.3-5.8 log 10 PFU, they did not trigger reactogenicity. When vaccinated mice were challenged with CHIKV, neither adult nor neonatal mice gained weight, had fever, or displayed signs of neurological illness. Upon comparison of the chimeras with the Army181/25 vaccine, the Army vaccine resulted in higher levels of viremia and replication in the joints of neonatal mice. Because the joints are known targets of CHIKV, Wang et al. noted their vaccine might avoid the negative reactogenic side effects of the Army vaccine.',\n",
       "  \"After being subcutaneously vaccinated with 5.3-5.8 log 10 PFU of the chimeric vaccines, mice produced strong neutralizing antibody titers. The VEEV and EEEV chimeras yielded higher neutralizing antibody titers than the SINV chimera without being more virulent. On top of this, the VEEV and EEEV CHIKV chimeras seemed to be more immunogenic than the Army vaccine despite the chimeras' lower viremia and replication in the joints of neonatal mice  .Tiwari et al. adopted a different strategy using formalin inactivated CHIKV in combination with alhydrogel (Aluminum Hydroxide) as an adjuvant. This study clearly suggests that this vaccine elicits both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice, providing its immunogenic potential. A recent study by Couderc et al. showed passive immunization as a potential treatment for CHIKV infection. Using purified immunoglobulin extracted from convalescent CHIKV patients, they demonstrated effective neutralizing activity against CHIKV infection both in vitro and in vivo.\",\n",
       "  \"This thereby establishes a potential preventive and therapeutic approach to combat CHIKV infection. Pathogenesis studies conducted with related alpha virus, like RRV, have shown the role of macrophages in persistence on infection  . They also demonstrated the role of RRV-specific CD8 T cells in clearing viral load in infected patients, thereby warranting similar investigations with CHIKV and the importance of investigating a cell-mediated immune response-based vaccine against CHIKV  .There are always certain risks associated with live attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines  . One way to avoid these potential problems is to construct a consensus-based DNA vaccine. DNA based vaccines have an improved safety profile as compared to live or attenuated vaccines [51, 52] . A consequence of CHIKV's rapid evolution is difficulty in constructing a vaccine that will be able to Figure 3 . Levels of CHIKV-specific IgG in mice immunized with CHIKV vaccines.\",\n",

Serum was incubated for 1 h at 37uC on 96-well plates coated with 2 mg/ml of respective CHIKV peptides, and antibody was detected using anti-mouse IgG-HRP and OD was measured at 405 nm. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000623.g003 www.plosntds.org effectively protect large populations from multiple strains of the virus. One of the strengths of DNA consensus vaccines is its ability to induce cross-reactive immune responses against the three distinct phylogenetic groups of CHIKV. Also DNA-based vaccines can be produced more rapidly than protein-based vaccines.Recently, Muthumani et al. constructed a vaccine that was shown to induce both humoral and cellular immunity in vivo in 3-4-wk-old female C57/BL6 mice  .\",\n",
       "  'These mice were immunized using an in vivo electroporation method to deliver the vaccine into the quadriceps muscle. The consensus construct was designed against E1, E2, and the core protein capsid. To design the construct, they aligned 21 sequences of CHIKV isolated between 1952 and 2006, using strains from differing countries, including La Reunion Island. The most common nucleotide among the sequences was chosen at each position to be used in the consensus construct, taking care not to alter the reading frame. They conducted codon and RNA optimization, added a strong Kozak sequence, and substituted signal peptide with an immunoglobulin E leader sequence to improve vaccine efficacy.After immunizing the mice, spleens were harvested along with serum and tested to determine antibody titer. After three immunizations, consensus E1, E2, and C vaccines were shown to induce T-cell immune responses leading to strong IFN-c responses and proliferation in C57/BL6 mice.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, when compared with control mice, immunized mice had higher total IgG levels as well as higher anti-E1 specific, anti-E2 specific, and anti-C specific IgG antibodies, suggesting a strong humoral immune response ( Figure 3 ) and also specificity for the antigens encoded in the vaccine constructs ( Figure 4 ). Because of its promising results and the need for a safer vaccine, this consensus DNA vaccine deserves further investigation. Determining longevity of protective effects of the vaccine and persistence of antibody and IFN-c responses could be the next step of investigation. Challenged studies of immunized mice must also be carried out.CHIKV mosquito-borne disease has caused massive outbreaks for at least half a century but is no longer confined to the www.plosntds.org developing nations. It began to encroach into the boundaries of the developing world. As a result, the NIAID has designated CHIKV as a Category C pathogen alongside the influenza and SARS-CoV viruses  .',\n",
       "  'Realization of the potential severity of this disease is exigent; for instance, if used as a biological weapon, the world economy could be severely crippled; if enough members of the armed forces were to become infected during a military deployment, military operations could be significantly affected. Efforts to monitor the disease will only provide minimal warning in a global society, and steps to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with pandemic are imperative [21, 31] . Despite the gravity of its infectious potency and the fear of it being a potential biological weapon, there is currently no vaccine for CHIKV infections. Live attenuated vaccine trials were carried out in 2000, but funding for the project was discontinued. Newer approaches such as DNA vaccines appear promising over conventional strategies like live attenuated or inactivated virus and thus call for further investigation. Recent advances such electroporation delivery and incorporation of adjuvants has boosted DNA vaccine efficacy [51, 53] .',\n",
       "  ' Despite the low antibody response to DNA vaccines, other numerous advantages have overshadowed these minor drawbacks (Table 2) , the most important one being the ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses [51, 54] .Judging by recent success, such as the immunogenic construct developed by Muthumani et al., DNA vaccines could play a major role in combating CHIKV  . Vaccines are literally a critical component of CHIKV disease control and therefore research in this area is highly encouraged. The dramatic spread of dengue viruses (DENV) throughout tropical America since 1980 via the same vectors and human hosts underscores the risk to public health in the Americas. The adverse events associated with the current live vaccine are well documented  . Realizing these drawbacks, earnest efforts should be taken to develop new strategies to forestall further spread and complications.'],\n",

       " ['Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.Text: Bats have received much attention in recent years for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus (Calisher et al., 2006; Wang and Anderson, 2019) .',\n",
       "  'In most non-Chiropteran mammals, henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses induce substantial morbidity and mortality, display short durations of infection, and elicit robust, long-term immunity in hosts surviving infection (Nicholls et al., 2003; Hooper et al., 2001; Mahanty and Bray, 2004) . Bats, by contrast, demonstrate no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals (Schountz et al., 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as longterm persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies (Plowright et al., 2016) .Recent research advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which bats avoid pathology from these otherwise virulent pathogens (Brook and Dobson, 2015) . Bats leverage a suite of species-specific mechanisms to limit viral load, which include host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN-a, for others (Zhou et al., 2016) .',\n",
       "  'Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-a and IFN-b), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively antiviral (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006) . In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or DNA (Zhou et al., 2016) . In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation (Zhang et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018) that may have evolved to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight (Kacprzyk et al., 2017) . The extent to which constitutive IFN-a expression signifies constitutive antiviral defense in the form of functional IFN-a protein remains unresolved.',\n",
       "  \"In bat cells constitutively expressing IFN-a, some protein-stimulated, downstream ISGs appear to be also constitutively expressed, but additional ISG induction is nonetheless possible following viral challenge and stimulation of IFN-b (Zhou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018) . Despite recent advances in molecular understanding of bat viral tolerance, the consequences of this unique bat immunity on within-host virus dynamics-and its implications for understanding zoonotic emergence-have yet to be elucidated.The field of 'virus dynamics' was first developed to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates (Nowak and May, 2000; Ho et al., 1995) . Models of simple target cell depletion, in which viral load is dictated by a bottom-eLife digest Bats can carry viruses that are deadly to other mammals without themselves showing serious symptoms.\",\n",
       "  'In fact, bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals -including rabies, Ebola and the SARS coronavirus.Bats have a suite of antiviral defenses that keep the amount of virus in check. For example, some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on. In most other mammals, having such a hyper-vigilant immune response would cause harmful inflammation. Bats, however, have adapted anti-inflammatory traits that protect them from such harm, include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation. However, no one has previously explored how these unique antiviral defenses of bats impact the viruses themselves. Now, Brook et al. have studied this exact question using bat cells grown in the laboratory.',\n",
       "  \"The experiments made use of cells from one bat species -the black flying fox -in which the interferon pathway is always on, and another -the Egyptian fruit bat -in which this pathway is only activated during an infection. The bat cells were infected with three different viruses, and then Brook et al. observed how the interferon pathway helped keep the infections in check, before creating a computer model of this response. The experiments and model helped reveal that the bats' defenses may have a potential downside for other animals, including humans. In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not.The findings may help to explain why bats are often the source for viruses that are deadly in humans.\",\n",
       "  \"Learning more about bats' antiviral defenses and how they drive virus evolution may help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans. More studies are needed in bats to help these efforts. In the meantime, the experiments highlight the importance of warning people to avoid direct contact with wild bats. up resource supply of infection-susceptible host cells, were first developed for HIV (Perelson, 2002) but have since been applied to other chronic infections, including hepatitis-C virus (Neumann et al., 1998) , hepatitis-B virus (Nowak et al., 1996) and cytomegalovirus (Emery et al., 1999) .\",\n",
       "  'Recent work has adopted similar techniques to model the within-host dynamics of acute infections, such as influenza A and measles, inspiring debate over the extent to which explicit modeling of top-down immune control can improve inference beyond the basic resource limitation assumptions of the target cell model (Baccam et al., 2006; Pawelek et al., 2012; Saenz et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2018) .To investigate the impact of unique bat immune processes on in vitro viral kinetics, we first undertook a series of virus infection experiments on bat cell lines expressing divergent interferon phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model elucidating the dynamics of within-host viral spread. We evaluated our theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity.',\n",
       "  'Finally, we confirmed our findings in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from our mean field model. We hypothesized that top-down immune processes would overrule classical resource-limitation in bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature, offering a testable prediction for models fit to empirical data. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses would be associated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates but also protect cells against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture.We first explored the influence of innate immune phenotype on within-host viral propagation in a series of infection experiments in cell culture. We conducted plaque assays on six-well plate monolayers of three immortalized mammalian kidney cell lines:  Vero (African green monkey) cells, which are IFN-defective and thus limited in antiviral capacity (Desmyter et al., 1968) ;  RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells which demonstrate idiosyncratic induced interferon responses upon viral challenge (Kuzmin et al., 2017; Arnold et al., 2018; Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018) ; and  PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells which constitutively express IFN-a (Zhou et al., 2016; Crameri et al., 2009) .',\n",
       "  'To intensify cell line-specific differences in constitutive immunity, we carried out infectivity assays with GFP-tagged, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses: rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV, which have been previously described (Miller et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2010) . Two of these viruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV, are recombinants for which cell entry is mediated by the glycoprotein of the bat-evolved filoviruses, Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV), thus allowing us to modulate the extent of structural, as well as immunological, antiviral defense at play in each infection. Previous work in this lab has demonstrated incompatibilities in the NPC1 filovirus receptor which render PaKiT01 cells refractory to infection with rVSV-MARV (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results) , making them structurally antiviral, over and above their constitutive expression of IFN-a. All three cell lines were challenged with all three viruses at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.001 and 0.0001.',\n",
       "  'Between 18 and 39 trials were run at each cell-virus-MOI combination, excepting rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells at MOI = 0.001, for which only eight trials were run (see Materials and methods; Figure 1 -figure supplements 1-3, Supplementary file 1).Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space (Howat et al., 2006) , we were able to track the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers via inverted fluorescence microscopy. For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see Materials and methods).',\n",
       "  'We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combination ( Figure 1; Figure 1 -figure supplements 1-5).All three recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV) infected Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 tissue cultures at both focal MOIs. Post-invasion, virus spread rapidly across most cell monolayers, resulting in virus-induced epidemic extinction. Epidemics were less severe in bat cell cultures, especially when infected with the recombinant filoviruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Monolayer destruction was avoided in the case of rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells: in the former, persistent viral infection was maintained throughout the 200 hr duration of each experiment, while, in the latter, infection was eliminated early in the time series, preserving a large proportion of live, uninfectious cells across the duration of the experiment.',\n",
       "  \"We assumed this pattern to be the result of immune-mediated epidemic extinction (Figure 1) . Patterns from MOI = 0.001 were largely recapitulated at MOI = 0.0001, though at somewhat reduced total proportions (Figure 1-figure supplement 5 ).A theoretical model fit to in vitro data recapitulates expected immune phenotypes for bat cells We next developed a within-host model to fit to these data to elucidate the effects of induced and constitutive immunity on the dynamics of viral spread in host tissue ( Figure 1 ). The compartmental within-host system mimicked our two-dimensional cell culture monolayer, with cells occupying five distinct infection states: susceptible (S), antiviral (A), exposed (E), infectious (I), and dead (D). We modeled exposed cells as infected but not yet infectious, capturing the 'eclipse phase' of viral integration into a host cell which precedes viral replication.\",\n",
       "  'Antiviral cells were immune to viral infection, in accordance with the \\'antiviral state\\' induced from interferon stimulation of ISGs in tissues adjacent to infection (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006) . Because we aimed to translate available data into modeled processes, we did not explicitly model interferon dynamics but instead scaled the rate of cell progression from susceptible to antiviral (r) by the proportion of exposed cells (globally) in the system. In systems permitting constitutive immunity, a second rate of cellular acquisition of antiviral status (\") additionally scaled with the global proportion of susceptible cells in the model.',\n",
       "  'Compared with virus, IFN particles are small and highly diffusive, justifying this global signaling assumption at the limited spatial extent of a six-well plate and maintaining consistency with previous modeling approximations of IFN signaling in plaque assay (Howat et al., 2006) .To best represent our empirical monolayer system, we expressed our state variables as proportions (P S , P A , P E , P I , and P D ), under assumptions of frequency-dependent transmission in a wellmixed population (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) , though note that the inclusion of P D (representing the proportion of dead space in the modeled tissue) had the functional effect of varying transmission with infectious cell density. This resulted in the following system of ordinary differential equations:We defined \\'induced immunity\\' as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral invasion at disease-free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through the term r. By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range of \" > 0, defining a \\'constitutive\\' system as one containing any antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium.',\n",

Since the extent to which constitutively-expressed IFN-a is constitutively translated into functional protein is not yet known for bat hosts (Zhou et al., 2016) , this approach permitted our tissue culture data to drive modeling inference: even in PaKiT01 cell lines known to constitutively express IFN-a, the true constitutive extent of the system (i.e. the quantity of antiviral cells present at disease-free equilibrium) was allowed to vary through estimation of \": For the purposes of model-fitting, we fixed the value of c, the return rate of antiviral cells to susceptible status, at 0.',\n",
       "  'The small spatial scale and short time course (max 200 hours) of our experiments likely prohibited any return of antiviral cells to susceptible status in our empirical system; nonetheless, we retained the term c in analytical evaluations of our model because regression from antiviral to susceptible status is possible over long time periods in vitro and at the scale of a complete organism (Radke et al., 1974; Rasmussen and Farley, 1975; Samuel and Knutson, 1982) .Before fitting to empirical time series, we undertook bifurcation analysis of our theoretical model and generated testable hypotheses on the basis of model outcomes. From our within-host model system (Equation 1-5), we derived the following expression for R 0 , the pathogen basic reproduction number (Supplementary file 2):Pathogens can invade a host tissue culture when R 0 >1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral acquisition (\") will drive R 0 <1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset.',\n",
       "  'Since, by definition, induced immunity is stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition (r) is not incorporated into the equation for R 0 ; while induced immune processes can control virus after initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or absent immunity (\" ¼ 0), the R 0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR model:At equilibrium, the theoretical, mean field model demonstrates one of three infection states: endemic equilibrium, stable limit cycles, or no infection ( Figure 2) . Respectively, these states approximate the persistent infection, virus-induced epidemic extinction, and immune-mediated epidemic extinction phenotypes previously witnessed in tissue culture experiments ( Figure 1 ). Theoretically, endemic equilibrium is maintained when new infections are generated at the same rate at which infections are lost, while limit cycles represent parameter space under which infectious and susceptible populations are locked in predictable oscillations.',\n",
       "  'Endemic equilibria resulting from cellular regeneration (i.e. births) have been described in vivo for HIV (Coffin, 1995) and in vitro for herpesvirus plaque assays (Howat et al., 2006) , but, because they so closely approach zero, true limit cycles likely only occur theoretically, instead yielding stochastic extinctions in empirical time series.Bifurcation analysis of our mean field model revealed that regions of no infection (pathogen extinction) were bounded at lower threshold (Branch point) values for b, below which the pathogen was unable to invade. We found no upper threshold to invasion for b under any circumstances (i.e. b high enough to drive pathogen-induced extinction), but high b values resulted in Hopf bifurcations, which delineate regions of parameter space characterized by limit cycles. Since limit cycles so closely approach zero, high bs recovered in this range would likely produce virus-induced epidemic extinctions under experimental conditions.',\n",
       "  'Under more robust representations of immunity, with higher values for either or both induced (r) and constitutive (\") rates of antiviral acquisition, Hopf bifurcations occurred at increasingly higher values for b, meaning that persistent infections could establish at higher viral transmission rates ( Figure 2 ). Consistent with our derivation for R 0 , we found that the Branch point threshold for viral invasion was independent of changes to the induced immune parameter (r) but saturated at high values of \" that characterize highly constitutive immunity ( Figure 3) .We next fit our theoretical model by least squares to each cell line-virus combination, under absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions of immunity. In general, best fit models recapitulated expected outcomes based on the immune phenotype of the cell line in question, as described in the general literature (Table 1 Ironically, the induced immune model offered a slightly better fit than the constitutive to rVSV-MARV infections on the PaKiT01 cell line (the one cell line-virus combination for which we know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play).',\n",

Special points from bifurcations analyses are listed in Supplementary file 3. space corresponding to theoretical limit cycles, consistent with observed virus-induced epidemic extinctions in stochastic tissue cultures.In contrast to Vero cells, the induced immunity model offered the best fit to all RoNi/7.1 data, consistent with reported patterns in the literature and our own validation by qPCR ( Table 1; Arnold et al., 2018; Kuzmin et al., 2017; Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018) . As in Vero cell trials, we estimated highest b values for rVSV-G infections on RoNi/7.1 cell lines but here recovered higher b estimates for rVSV-MARV than for rVSV-EBOV.',\n",
       "  'This reversal was balanced by a higher estimated rate of acquisition to antiviral status (r) for rVSV-EBOV versus rVSV-MARV. In general, we observed that more rapid rates of antiviral acquisition (either induced, r, constitutive, \", or both) correlated with higher transmission rates (b). When offset by r, b values estimated for RoNi/7.1 infections maintained the same amplitude as those estimated for immune-absent Vero cell lines but caused gentler epidemics and reduced cellular mortality (Figure 1) . RoNi/7.1 parameter estimates localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic, theoretical model (Figure 4) , yielding less acute epidemics which nonetheless went extinct in stochastic experiments.Finally, rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV trials on PaKiT01 cells were best fit by models assuming constitutive immunity, while rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 were matched equivalently by models assuming either induced or constitutive immunity-with induced models favored over constitutive in AIC comparisons because one fewer parameter was estimated (Figure 1-figure supplements 4-5; Supplementary file 4).',\n",
       "  'For all virus infections, PaKiT01 cell lines yielded b estimates a full order of magnitude higher than Vero or RoNi/7.1 cells, with each b balanced by an immune response (either r, or r combined with \") also an order of magnitude higher than that recovered for the other cell lines ( Figure 4 ; Table 1 ). As in RoNi/7.1 cells, PaKiT01 parameter fits localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic theoretical model. Because constitutive immune processes can actually prohibit initial pathogen invasion, constitutive immune fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines consistently localized at or below the Branch point threshold for virus invasion (R 0 ¼ 1). During model fitting for optimization of \", any parameter tests of \" values producing R 0 <1 resulted in no infection and, consequently, produced an exceedingly poor fit to infectious time series data.',\n",
       "  'In all model fits assuming constitutive immunity, across all cell lines, antiviral contributions from \" prohibited virus from invading at all. The induced immune model thus produced a more parsimonious recapitulation of these data because virus invasion was always permitted, then rapidly controlled.In order to compare the relative contributions of each cell line\\'s disparate immune processes to epidemic dynamics, we next used our mean field parameter estimates to calculate the initial \\'antiviral rate\\'-the initial accumulation rate of antiviral cells upon virus invasion for each cell-virus-MOI combination-based on the following equation:where P E was calculated from the initial infectious dose (MOI) of each infection experiment and P S was estimated at disease-free equilibrium:Because and \" both contribute to this initial antiviral rate, induced and constitutive immune assumptions are capable of yielding equally rapid rates, depending on parameter fits.',\n",
       "  'Indeed, under fully induced immune assumptions, the induced antiviral acquisition rate (r) estimated for rVSV-MARV infection on PaKiT01 cells was so high that the initial antiviral rate exceeded even that estimated under constitutive assumptions for this cell-virus combination (Supplementary file 4) . In reality, we know that NPC1 receptor incompatibilities make PaKiT01 cell lines constitutively refractory to rVSV-MARV infection (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results) and that PaKiT01 cells also constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-a. Model fitting results suggest that this constitutive expression of IFN-a may act more as a rapidly inducible immune response following virus invasion than as a constitutive secretion of functional IFN-a protein. Nonetheless, as hypothesized, PaKiT01 cell lines were by far the most antiviral of any in our study-with initial antiviral rates estimated several orders of magnitude higher than any others in our study, under either induced or constitutive assumptions ( Table 1 ; Supplementary file 4).',\n",
       "  'RoNi/7.1 cells displayed the second-most-pronounced signature of immunity, followed by Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was essentially zero even under forced assumptions of induced or constitutive immunity ( Table 1 ; Supplementary file 4).Using fitted parameters for b and \", we additionally calculated R 0 , the basic reproduction number for the virus, for each cell line-virus-MOI combination ( Table 1 ; Supplementary file 4). We found that R 0 was essentially unchanged across differing immune assumptions for RoNi/7.1 and Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was low. In the case of PaKiT01 cells, a high initial antiviral rate under either induced or constitutive immunity resulted in a correspondingly high estimation of b (and, consequently, R 0 ) which still produced the same epidemic curve that resulted from the much lower estimates for b and R 0 paired with absent immunity.',\n",
       "  'These findings suggest that antiviral immune responses protect host tissues against virus-induced cell mortality and may facilitate the establishment of more rapid within-host transmission rates.Total monolayer destruction occurred in all cell-virus combinations excepting rVSV-EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1 cells and rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells. Monolayer destruction corresponded to susceptible cell depletion and epidemic turnover where R-effective (the product of R 0 and the proportion susceptible) was reduced below one ( Figure 5) . For rVSV-EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1, induced antiviral cells safeguarded remnant live cells, which birthed new susceptible cells late in the time series. In rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells, this antiviral protection halted the epidemic ( Figure 5 ; R-effective <1) before susceptibles fully declined. In the case of rVSV-EBOV on PaKiT01, the birth of new susceptibles from remnant live cells protected by antiviral status maintained late-stage transmission to facilitate long-term epidemic persistence.',\n",
       "  'Importantly, under fixed parameter values for the infection incubation rate (s) and infectioninduced mortality rate (a), models were unable to reproduce the longer-term infectious time series captured in data from rVSV-EBOV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines without incorporation of cell births, an assumption adopted in previous modeling representations of IFN-mediated viral dynamics in tissue culture (Howat et al., 2006) . In our experiments, we observed that cellular reproduction took place as plaque assays achieved confluency. Finally, because the protective effect of antiviral cells is more clearly observable spatially, we confirmed our results by simulating fitted time series in a spatially-explicit, stochastic reconstruction of our mean field model. In spatial simulations, rates of antiviral acquisition were fixed at fitted values for r and \" derived from mean field estimates, while transmission rates (b) were fixed at values ten times greater than those estimated under mean field conditions, accounting for the intensification of parameter thresholds permitting pathogen invasion in local spatial interactions (see Materials and methods; Videos 1-3; Figure 5-figure supplement 3; Supplementary file 5; Webb et al., 2007) .',\n",
       "  \"In immune capable time series, spatial antiviral cells acted as 'refugia' which protected live cells from infection as each initial epidemic wave 'washed' across a cell monolayer. Eventual birth of new susceptibles from these living refugia allowed for sustained epidemic transmission in cases where some infectious cells persisted at later timepoints in simulation (Videos 1-3; Figure 5-figure supplement 3 ).Bats are reservoirs for several important emerging zoonoses but appear not to experience disease from otherwise virulent viral pathogens. Though the molecular biological literature has made great progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which bats tolerate viral infections (Zhou et al., 2016; Ahn et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013) , the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics within-host has not been well-elucidated. We used an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.\",\n",
       "  'Critically, we found that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates (b). These results were supported by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection. Our findings suggest that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts.',\n",
       "  'Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.To achieve these results, we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model\\'s equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for \", the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. In deriving the equation for R 0 , the basic reproduction number, which defines threshold conditions for virus invasion of a tissue (R 0 >1), we demonstrated how the invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition, \". Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc.',\n",
       "  'Once thresholds for pathogen invasion have been met, assumptions of constitutive immunity will limit the cellular mortality (virulence) incurred at high transmission rates. Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. Fitting of our model to in vitro data supported expected immune phenotypes for different bat cell lines as described in the literature. Simple target cell models that ignore the effects of immunity best recapitulated infectious time series derived from IFN-deficient Vero cells, while models assuming induced immune processes most accurately reproduced trials derived from RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells, which possess a standard virusinduced IFN-response. In most cases, models assuming constitutive immune processes best recreated virus epidemics produced on PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells, which are known to constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-a (Zhou et al., 2016) .',\n",
       "  'Model support for induced immune assumptions in fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggests that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense. Results from mean field model fitting were additionally confirmed in spatially explicit stochastic simulations of each time series.As previously demonstrated in within-host models for HIV (Coffin, 1995; Perelson et al., 1996; Nowak et al., 1995; Bonhoeffer et al., 1997; Ho et al., 1995) , assumptions of simple target-cell depletion can often provide satisfactory approximations of viral dynamics, especially those reproduced in simple in vitro systems. Critically, our model fitting emphasizes the need for incorporation of top-down effects of immune control in order to accurately reproduce infectious time series derived from bat cell tissue cultures, especially those resulting from the robustly antiviral PaKiT01 P. alecto cell line.',\n",
       "  \"These findings indicate that enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. We nonetheless acknowledge the limitations imposed by in vitro experiments in tissue culture, especially involving recombinant viruses and immortalized cell lines. Future work should extend these cell culture studies to include measurements of multiple state variables (i.e. antiviral cells) to enhance epidemiological inference.The continued recurrence of Ebola epidemics across central Africa highlights the importance of understanding bats' roles as reservoirs for virulent zoonotic disease. The past decade has born witness to emerging consensus regarding the unique pathways by which bats resist and tolerate highly virulent infections (Brook and Dobson, 2015; Xie et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2015; Pavlovich et al., 2018) .\",\n",
       "  'Nonetheless, an understanding of the mechanisms by which bats support endemic pathogens at the population level, or promote the evolution of virulent pathogens at the individual level, remains elusive. Endemic maintenance of infection is a defining characteristic of a pathogen reservoir (Haydon et al., 2002) , and bats appear to merit such a title, supporting long-term persistence of highly transmissible viral infections in isolated island populations well below expected critical community sizes (Peel et al., 2012) . Researchers debate the relative influence of population-level and within-host mechanisms which might explain these trends (Plowright et al., 2016) , but increasingly, field data are difficult to reconcile without acknowledgement of a role for persistent infections (Peel et al., 2018; Brook et al., 2019) . We present general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes.',\n",

Due to uncertainty over the exact epidemic state of Hoechst-stained cells (i.e. exposed but not yet infectious cells may still stain), we elected to fit our models only to the infectious time series derived from GFPexpressing images and used Hoechst stain images as a post hoc visual check on our fit only ( Figure 5 ; Figure 5 -figure supplements 1-2).Images recovered from the time series above were processed into binary ('infectious' vs. 'non-infectious' or, for Hoechst-stained images, 'live' vs. 'dead') form using the EBImage package (Pau et al., 2010) in R version 3.6 for MacIntosh, after methods further detailed in Supplementary file 7.\",\n",

The birth rate, b, was multiplied by the proportion of susceptible cells within a six-neighbor circumference of a focal dead cell, while b was multiplied by the proportion of infectious cells within a thirty-six neighbor vicinity of a focal susceptible cell, thus allowing viral transmission to extend beyond the immediate nearestneighbor boundaries of an infectious cell.',\n",
       "  'To compensate for higher thresholds to cellular persistence and virus invasion which occur under local spatial conditions (Webb et al., 2007) , we increased the birth rate, b, and the cell-to-cell transmission rate, b, respectively, to six and ten times the values used in the mean field model (Supplementary file 4) . We derived these increases based on the assumption that births took place exclusively based on pairwise nearest-neighbor interactions (the six immediately adjacent cells to a focal dead cell), while viral transmission was locally concentrated but included a small (7.5%) global contribution, representing the thirty-six cell surrounding vicinity of a focal susceptible. We justify these increases and derive their origins further in Supplementary file 5.We simulated ten stochastic spatial time series for all cell-virus combinations under all three immune assumptions at a population size of 10,000 cells and compared model output with data in .',\n",

       " ['As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in ‘lockdown’ directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation’s economy and its economic and political influence.',\n",
       "  'This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.Text: The novel Coronavirus outbreak, (previously known as the 2019-nCoV and later renamed COVID-19 during the writing of this manuscript) is leading to the closure of entire cities in China, and causing stringent measures to be taken in others. While in distant different continents, far from China where the virus was first reported, places are being placed on high alert. In Wuhan, where the virus broke, schools, roads and markets have been shut down  . The same is true in Hong Kong, Beijing and Hubei Province amongst surrounding areas, as precautionary measures are being emphasized to ensure that the spread of the virus is minimized, and complete and accurate information on the virus is being obtained  .',\n",
       "  'However, the rate of spread of the virus and the uncertainties surrounding the entire situation has led the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2019 to declare the Coronavirus outbreak a \\'Global Public Health Emergency\\'. WHO determined, however, not to declare the outbreak a \\'Public Health Emergency of International Concern\\' (PHEIC) which is a higher level of declaration. A PHEIC is defined as \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\" whose scope may include: serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State\\'s national border; and may require immediate international action  .With the world having experienced some notable influenza pandemics in the past, a Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform  was established and was instrumental in the rapid sharing of information by the Chinese scientists regarding the emergence of the COVID-19 virus.',\n",
       "  'Through this platform, scientists from other regions were observed to gain access to information and are, subsequently, able to act in a much faster capacity; like in the case of scientists from the Virus Identification Laboratory based at Doherty Institute, Australia, who managed to grow a similar virus in the laboratory after accessing the data shared by the Chinese scientists  .Beyond the aspect of pandemic preparedness and response, the case of COVID-19 virus and its spread provide a fascinating case study for the thematics of urban health. Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios.',\n",
       "  'This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products [6, 7] that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally. While thermal cameras are not sufficient on their own for the detection of pandemics -like the case of the COVID-19, the integration of such products with artificial intelligence (AI) can provide added benefits. The fact that initial screenings of temperature is being pursued for the case of the COVID-19 at airports and in areas of mass convergence is a testament to its potential in an automated fashion. Kamel Boulos et al.',\n",
       "  'supports that data from various technological products can help enrich health databases, provide more accurate, efficient, comprehensive and real-time information on outbreaks and their dispersal, thus aiding in the provision of better urban fabric risk management decisions.The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves. Weber and Podnar Žarko  suggest that IoT devices in use should support open protocols, and at the same time, the device provider should ensure that those fashioned uphold data integrity and safety during communication and transmission. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, as Vermesan and Friess  explain, most smart city products use proprietary solutions that are only understood by the service providers. This situation often creates unnecessary fragmentation of information rendering only a partial integrated view on the dynamics of the urban realm.',\n",
       "  'With restricted knowledge on emergent trends, urban managers cannot effectively take decisions to contain outbreaks and adequately act without compromising the social and economic integrity of their city. This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities.With the advent of the digital age and the plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices it brings, there has been a substantial rise in the amount of data gathered by these devices in different sectors like transport, environment, entertainment, sport and health sectors, amongst others  . To put this into perspective, it is believed that by the end of 2020, over 2314 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 billion gigabytes) of data will be generated globally  from the health sector.',\n",
       "  'Stanford Medicine  acknowledges that this increase, especially in the medical field, is witnessing a proportional increase due to the increase in sources of data that are not limited to hospital records. Rather, the increase is being underpinned by drawing upon a myriad and increasing number of IoT smart devices, that are projected to exponentially increase the global healthcare market to a value of more than USD $543.3 billion by 2025  . However, while the potential for the data market is understood, such issues like privacy of information, data protection and sharing, and obligatory requirements of healthcare management and monitoring, among others, are critical. Moreover, in the present case of the Coronavirus outbreak, this ought to be handled with care to avoid jeopardizing efforts already in place to combat the pandemic.',\n",
       "  \"On the foremost, since these cut across different countries, which are part of the global community and have their unique laws and regulations concerning issues mentioned above, it is paramount to observe them as per the dictate of their source country's laws and regulations; hence, underlining the importance of working towards not only the promoting of data through its usage but also the need for standardized and universally agreed protocols.While the significance of such data in advancing efficiency, productivity and processes in different sectors is being lauded, there are criticisms arising as to the nature of data collection, storage, management and accessibility by only a small group of users. The latter particularly includes select ICT corporations that are also located in specific geographies [6,     . These criticisms are justified, as in recent years, big data is seen as the new 'gold rush' of the 21st century and limiting its access means higher economic returns and increased influence and control at various scales to those who control data.\",\n",
       "  \"These associated benefits with big data are clearly influencing geopolitical standings, in both corporate and conventional governance realms, and there is increased competition between powerful economies to ensure that they have the maximum control of big data. As case in point is the amount of 'push and pull' that has arisen from Huawei's 5G internet planned rollout  . Though the latter service offers unprecedented opportunities to increase internet speeds, and thereby influence the handling of big data, countries like the U.S. and some European countries that are key proponents and players in global political, economic and health landscapes, are against this rollout, arguing that it is a deceptive way of gathering private data under the guise of espionage. On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in.\",\n",
       "  'Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically    . Such are deemed prized tokens on the international landscape, and it is expected that these economies will continue to work towards their predominant control as much as possible. On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections.In addition to the obvious deep-rooted social issues related to nationalism, other challenges include the increasing movement of people globally that is being enhanced by reduced costs and higher speed. In particular, these challenges are more pronounced when it comes to public health.',\n",
       "  'This is because most of the health-related data collected not only can compromise local nations, but also captures those of travelers. In such cases, in a bid to improve the health status of a nation, it becomes paramount to factor in data from other regions necessitating unhindered sharing of this data.Such data-sharing truth is emphasized in situations like the recent case of Coronavirus outbreak threatening the global health environment, facilitated by air transportation. The virus was first reported in Wuhan, China, and in a matter of three weeks (by 17th January 2020) over 300 cases were confirmed in that region, and 10 days later (26th January 2020), a total of 2014 cases of Coronavirus have been reported, with 684 of those being confirmed, and with 29 reported outside China. The fatalities from the virus stands at 56 as of 26th January 2020  .',\n",
       "  'The virus had then been confirmed in various countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, France, the United States, Singapore and Vietnam  .In the above case, though major cities are known to prepare themselves for potential outbreaks, their health policies and protocols are observed to diverge from one another. Thus, without a global collaborative approach, progress towards working for a cure and universally acceptable policy approach can take longer. Such fears, of a lack of international collaboration, were highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) during an emergency meeting in Geneva on 22nd January 2020 to determine whether the virus outbreak had reached a level warranting international emergency concern. However, WHO was satisfied that China was being proactive in this case, unlike in 2002, when China withheld information on the outbreak for far too long, causing delays in addressing the epidemic  .',\n",
       "  'As in this instance, it is the opinion in this paper that if there was seamless collaboration and seamless sharing of data between different cities, it would not warrant such a high-level meeting to result in action, and instead, a decision could have been made much earlier. On this, the saddest part is that some global cities are less prepared to handle the challenges posed by this type of outbreak for lack of information on issues like symptoms of the virus, the protective measures to be taken, and the treatment procedures that an infected person should be processed through, amongst other issues.The timely response by stakeholders in regard to this new outbreak are commendable compared to previous cases.',\n",
       "  \"The latter includes the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 that took substantial time (from November 2002 to April 2003) to identify and be dealt with  ; the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2013 that took months to determine; and the Zika Virus that was first reported in 2014 before being successfully identified in 2015.With the Coronavirus (COVID-19) , it took only 17 days (31st December 2019 to 17th January 2020) to be identified. The sharing of data has also been quicker, as immediately after the virus' genetic sequence was discovered, Chinese scientists were able to share the information with the WHO, thus helping in its identification and enabling the auctioning of precautionary measures in other countries. Latest technological tools have also allowed for the receipt of information in realtime, in contrast to traditional epidemiological approaches that would have required months to identify the outbreak type  .\",\n",
       "  'Similarly, though substantial data and information on the disease has been shared, Wetsman  acknowledges that there is a lack of some vital information, like the ease of spread of the virus from person-to-person, and this is a key to containing the disease as interactions between people from different parts of the globe are still active. This hindrance can be made further possible as many cities advance in their smart and safe city model implementation towards constructing sufficient soft and hard urban infrastructures equipped with, for example, thermal imagery sensors to allow for early detections. However, while that is the case, data access to many is a challenge because the information is often seen as being sensitive for national security reasons, whilst at the same time, acknowledging that a virus outbreak is an equal threat to both national security and the economy.The outbreak of any disease has significant impacts on local economies across the globe.',\n",
       "  'For instance, when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (SARS-CoV) broke in China in 2002, it was estimated, that the Asian region incurred tremendous negative impacts socially, health-wise and economically, potentially amounting to Asian regional economy losses of between USD $12-18 billion from tourism, travel and retail sales industries alone  . The Zika virus outbreak, spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, is estimated to have cost equator-belt local economies in affected areas between USD $7 and USD $18 billion  . The Ebola virus (or Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF)) caused an estimated loss of USD $2.2 billion in GDP in three West African economies (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) in 2015 alone  . In regard to the current epidemic of Coronavirus, though it is too early to quantify or project its impacts on the global economy, there are fears that it may take the precedent of other outbreaks where billions of dollars will be lost.',\n",
       "  'The foundations for this escalating loss can be witnessed in the rapid growth of travel bans being enacted by some countries and their international airports, especially specifically restricting people from visiting the affected regions in China and their growth into general non-Chinese travel movements. On this, noting that the outbreak came almost on the eve of the Lunar New Year celebrations, and that it had been estimated that over 400 million people were expected to travel in different parts of the world and China to observe this festivity, the majority have had to reconsider their options as to flights, hotels and entertainment events due to service provider cancellations  . Those who had already booked their flights are expected to receive their refunds following the directive by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, however, this move has already affected the share value of Chinese airline companies  .The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al.',\n",
       "  'posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued.Virus outbreaks in recent years have shown that, in the urban realm, data, including health data, can be sourced from diverse places. Presently, in the case of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, data is being collected from airports through screening and monitoring, through the use of smart sensors installed in airport infrastructures and from personnel working in those air/seaports. For instance, it has been reported that in the U.S.A., screening is being carried out at 20 different airports to ensure that possible affected people are intercepted for quarantine at the point of entry. Beside airports, as reported by Buckley and May  , data is also being collected at bus terminals, market places (in Wuhan), subways, and also in health facilities where patients are taken for further medical attention.',\n",
       "  'Such is prevalent especially in China, and other Asian regions where cases of the virus have been recorded and confirmed.In addition to these methods, other smart city data sources include the application of terminal tracking systems that are mostly emphasized in Safe City concepts, where, at the point of entry or departure, relevant data is collected and analyzed. Li et al. highlights that sensors installed in such locations have the potential to receive and distribute data in real-time to digital infrastructures within the network, and their interconnectedness in the network renders them extremely efficient in providing real-time updates on different issues. Urban areas are also known to be amassed with numerous Urban Health sensors, some of which are wearable. Though these are not specifically fashioned to track the present case of virus outbreak, they are able to track other related parameters like heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature and others variables, that when analyzed can offer valuable insights.',\n",
       "  'Loncar-Turukalo et al. hail these devices for their role in transforming the health care sector especially by allowing for Connected Health (CH) care, where data collected from them can be analyzed and provide insightful information on the health scenario in any given area. Vashist et al. further highlight how emerging features such as spatiotemporal mapping, remote monitoring and management, and enhanced cloud computing capabilities can emanate from such endeavours, leading to better urban management potential.While it is true that the basic source of medical data is generally sourced from general practitioners or medical laboratories-a fact that has also been affirmed in the case of the current epidemic-this paper explores how data sourced from an urban perspective can contribute to the medical narrative.',\n",
       "  'The conviction to dwell on the urban realm in this manuscript is based on the fact that the current epidemic (COVID-19) is transmitted majorly through human-to-human contact, and in most cases, especially where the spread is reported in a different country, the first point of contact is an urban area, where large groups of people convene, like airports or subway stations. In most cases, such facilities, which are mostly based in urban areas, are observed to have installed surveillance technologies to ensure that anyone showing any symptoms of the disease are identified and quarantined. However, even in such cases, as underlined in the present manuscript, the need for anonymizing medical data is emphasized to ensure that the use of current technologies does not breach data privacy and security requirements, across different geographies. In this case, novel technologies like Blockchain technologies and quantum cryptography can aid in the discussion and be made to integrate with data collecting technologies.',\n",
       "  'This would render an increased wealth of data from both the medical field and smart city operators, while ensuring privacy and security; hence, aiding in providing relevant information for better informed decisions.However, despite the indisputable roles that installed devices play in providing relevant health information, their data communication aspect needs to be reviewed. First, communications are seen to be geography-restricted (restricted to a given location), such that they seldom expand or communicate with their like, installed beyond their restricted areas. Secondly, these devices are usually sourced and installed by separate corporations that maintain unique and specific standards for data processing and sharing, and accordingly, tying cities to the sole usage of their product(s). Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding [6, 7] .For its current application, the standardization of protocols as elaborated in this manuscript need to be pursued to ensure that there is seamless sharing of information and data.',\n",
       "  'By doing this, it is expected that issues like burdens of collecting data, accuracy and other complexity that are experienced (when systems are fragmented) are reduced or eliminated altogether. The standardization can be achieved by, for example, ensuring that all the devices and systems are linked into a single network, like was done in the U.S., where all the surveillance of healthcare were combined into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSH)  . The fact that cities are increasingly tuning on the concept of Smart Cities and boasting an increased adoption rate of technological and connected products, existing surveillance networks can be re-calibrated to make use of those new sets of databases. Appropriate protocols however have to be drafted to ensure effective actions while ensuring privacy and security of data and people.With scenarios like the present Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, that not only impacts upon the economic status of cities, but also affects their social standing, it becomes imperative to emphasize the adoption of universal standards for data sharing.',\n",
       "  'Such a move could have far reaching impact across cities and territories especially in positively combating outbreaks and disasters in a quicker, safer and standardized way, such that when the cure is discovered, the results can be replicated in various parts of the globe. With a collaborated data sharing protocol, it would be possible to have a larger dataset resulting in increased processing capabilities especially with technologies that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Through this way, as noted by Jiang et al. and Allam  , it would be possible to facilitate early detection, achieve better diagnosis and provide better urban management decisions for increased efficiency for virus containment.An example of how beneficial collaboration and sharing of data can be occurred during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa where scientists, health workers and clinicians, amongst other stakeholders from around the world, openly worked together and were able to contain the spread of this pandemic  .',\n",
       "  'On this front, Boué et al. highlight that levels of trust and transparency need to be reviewed and enhanced to facilitate unfettered data generation and sharing. Such could lead to an even earlier detection scenario of future virus outbreaks, and in the better curative management of the same, without minimal compromise on urban functions and on an urban economy.Furthermore, in cases of emergencies like the current outbreak of COVID-19 and any other, the need for observance of regulatory practices and international healthcare guidelines are paramount. This would ensure that both healthcare professionals and the general populace are informed, protected and remain within the prescribed rules and regulations. As noted by the WHO  , the healthcare guidelines and regulatory practices are advanced to also ensure that the health risk in question is reduced together with its consequences. In the current era of technological advancement, such regulations and guidelines are paramount as they have potential to lead to positive or negative outcomes.',\n",
       "  ' The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.'],\n",

This is especially true for viral diseases that are easily and readily transmissible and have asymptomatic infectivity periods. The novel Coronavirus (SARSCoV2) described in December 2019 has resulted in major quarantines throughout the world, including major cites, villages and public areas throughout China    to prevent further spread.

China has built several new hospitals in an attempt to manage the infected individuals  . It is imperative that we evaluate novel models in an attempt to control the rapidly spreading virus  .In order to reduce the time to identification of a person under investigation (PUI) for the COVID-19 infection, and the rapid isolation of this individual, we propose to collect the basic travel history along with the more common manifestations using a phone-based online survey. Such collected data can be used to assist in the preliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 infected individuals.',\n",

The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance of spread. Table 1 is inserted here.See Appendix I for the details on the steps involved in data collection on all the respondents independent of whether or not they think they are infected. The AI algorithm described in Appendix II is to identify possible case identifications and send alerts to the nearest health clinic as well as to the respondent for an immediate health visit, we call this as an \"alert for health check recommendation for COVID-2019.',\n",

If a respondent does not have an immediate risk of having symptoms or signs related to the viral infection, then the AI-based health alert will be sent to the respondent to notify them that there is no current risk of COVID-2019. Figure 1 summarizes the outcomes of data collection and identification of possible cases. The data recorded in step 5 of the algorithm using signs and symptoms will be collected prior to both the groups who have received alerts HCRC or MHCRC (for possible identification and assessment) and NCRC (for non-identified respondents).These are explained in steps (iii) and (iv) in the Appendix II.',\n",

In the 57, 6 cases were detected to be blood positive, all of them (100%) were severe in symptom requiring special care attention, and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood, only 12 of them (23.5%) were severe cases.',\n",
       "  'The ratio of severe symptoms between these two groups was significantly different (p value = 0.0001). In the anal swab cohort (Figure 1 (B)), 11 of 28 cases were detected to be anal swab positive, 8 of them (72.7%) were with severe symptoms, which was significantly higher than that 4 (23.5%) of the rest 17 cases without detectable virus in anal were severe cases.Fortunately, two cases with detectable virus both in blood and anal swab cohort were recorded. Patient 1 (Figure 2 (A)) was admitted to ICU after enrollment evaluation and was highly suspected infection with 2019-nCoV because of his recent travelling from Wuhan and of confirmed pneumonia by radiographic diagnosis with 5-day fever and 1-day continuous dry coughing. He was then confirmed to be infected by the 2019-nCoV virus on illness day 6 by CDC.',\n",

In the blood, no viral RNA was detected on day 5 but the sample on day 6 gave a weak positive signal (Ct = Neg+39), and then the signal was gone again on day 8. On day 9, a low level of viral RNA (Ct = 36 + 41) was detected again in the blood. On day 12, the blood lost signal again. A high concentration of virus RNA (Ct = 23 + 27) was detected in the anal sample on day 13, on the day the 2019-nCoV virus was not detected in the pharyngeal swab.',\n",

The virus was detected in his blood on illness day 7 (Ct = 34 + 36) and 8 (Ct = 38 + 38). His infection was also informed by the CDC on day 8. Because his disease advanced very fast, he was transferred to the ICU ward for special medical care requirements on day 9, on which day high titers of virus (Ct = 25 + 36) were detected in the pharyngeal sample. Importantly, virus RNA was detected in all pharyngeal (Ct = 23 + 24), blood (Ct = 34 + 39) and anal (Ct = 24 + 29) samples on day 10.',\n",

Pharyngeal samples were PCR positive on days 14 and 17 and became negative on day 22. Patient 4 (Figure 3(B) ) was transferred to the ICU ward on the illness day 6 with a CDC confirmation. His disease advanced pretty fast and became severe on day 7 and he was transferred to ICU after his blood sample was detected to be virus-positive (Ct = 32 + 37).

Her disease progressed rapidly to a severe stage within the next 3 days. Patient 6 ( Figure 3 (D)) with a clear history of virus infection was confirmed to be infected on infection day 7. Viral RNA was detected in his blood sample on day 9, one day ahead of his transfer into ICU. As his condition worsens, he was transferred out on day 13.In this retrospective study, we analyzed the PCR data of virus detection in different tissues in our laboratory. Firstly, our observation indicated that the presence of viral RNA outside of the respiratory tract might herald the severity of the disease and alarm the requirement of special care.',\n",
       "  'In the blood test cohort, all the 6 infected patients were in (or later progressed to) severe disease stage when serum viral RNA became detectable, which showed a significant difference compared to the blood negative group (p = 0.0001). Patient 2 (Figure 2(B) ), 5 (Figure 3 (C)) and 6 ( Figure 3(D) ) all had detectable viral RNA in the serum before they progressed to the clinical severe symptom stage. Unfortunately, we missed the earlier time points of patient 1 (Figure 2(A) ) and 3 (Figure 3(A) ) who were directly admitted to ICU on transfer to our hospital because of severe condition, of patient 4 (Figure 3(B) ) who had serum sample collected one day post the diagnosis of severe illness. We, fortunately, observed high serum viral load in serum within their severe illness stage.',\n",
       "  'In the anal swab cohort, we found that the presence of virus RNA in the anal digestive tract was also positively correlated with disease severity (p = 0.0102). The 3 patients detected with anal virus RNA but in mild stage should be monitored whether they will progress to the severe stage. We have summarized the information of approximately 70 percent of the patients in Guangzhou city, and the study represented nearly the whole picture of this region. However, the virus outbroke in such an emergence, allowing no delay in waiting for more patients to further confirm the findings.Secondly, a high concentration of viral RNA in anal swabs suggested the digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication. For patient 1, a high concentration of viral RNA (Ct = 23 + 27, on day 13) was detected in anal swab but not in pharyngeal (the same day) and blood (1 d ahead).',\n",
       "  'For patient 2, higher concentrations of viral RNAs were detected in anal swab (Ct = 24 + 39) and pharyngeal swab (Ct = 23 + 24) than in the blood (Ct = 34 + 39) on the same day. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) still is one of the receptors for 2019-nCoV attachment and entry  . Intensive structural analysis of the S protein of 2019-nCoV with the SARS-Coronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2  . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells  , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus.',\n",
       "  'We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa. Bat originated coronavirus was found to replicate in the swine digestive tract recently, also suggesting the potential replication possibility in the human digestive tract  . Nevertheless, confirmation of virus transmission through the digestive tract warrants further virus isolation from the anal swab in high safety level lab.Unfortunately, in our study, we did not collect stool samples from patients and did not pursue viral RNA in the stool. But we believe the existence of virus RNA in the stool samples from these patients because that a large amount of viral RNA was detected in anal swabs and that viral RNA had also been detected in a case reported from the United States  .',\n",
       "  \" Also, we didn't collect sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for virus detection because that the dry coughing characteristic of patients infected with 2019-nCoV prevents producing enough amount of sputum and that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection requires a sophisticated operation which increases virus exposure possibility of care providers to high concentrations of virus-containing aerosol.In summary, we find that the presence of viral RNA in the blood and anal swab is positively correlated with the severe disease stage and that early monitoring of virus RNA in blood and the digestive tract on top of the respiratory tract might benefit the disease prediction.\"],\n",
       " ['Background: The Ebola epidemic in West Africa caused global fear and stirred up worldwide preparedness activities in countries sharing borders with those affected, and in geographically far-away countries such as Iceland. Objective: To describe and analyse Ebola preparedness activities within the Icelandic healthcare system, and to explore the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers. Methods: A qualitative case study, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 staff members in the national Ebola Treatment Team, Emergency Room at Landspitali University Hospital, and managers of the response team. Results: Contextual factors such as culture and demography influenced preparedness, and contributed to the positive state of mind of participants, and ingenuity in using available resources for preparedness. While participants believed they were ready to take on the task of Ebola, they also had doubts about the chances of Ebola ever reaching Iceland.',\n",
       "  'Yet, factors such as fear of Ebola and the perceived stigma associated with caring for a potentially infected Ebola patient, influenced the preparation process and resulted in plans for specific precautions by staff to secure the safety of their families. There were also concerns about the teamwork and lack of commitment by some during training. Being a ‘tiny’ nation was seen as both an asset and a weakness in the preparation process. Honest information sharing and scenario-based training contributed to increased confidence amongst participants in the response plans. Conclusions: Communication and training were important for preparedness of health staff in Iceland, in order to receive, admit, and treat a patient suspected of having Ebola, while doubts prevailed on staff capacity to properly do so.',\n",

All three of the worst affected countries were to address the emerging epidemic challenge without staff, stuff, space and systems    . With the epidemic seemingly out of control, and a proportionately high number of doctors, nurses, and midwives succumbing to Ebola  , there was a growing fear of transmission beyond the region. In breach of WHO recommendations and guidelines  , flights were cancelled and cross-border movement curtailed  .',\n",
       "  \"The epidemic caused public concern outside West Africa  , as fear and racism found fertile ground    , and in an effort to stop the international spread of the disease, all states were advised to be prepared to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases  .Preparedness as part of disaster risk reduction is defined as 'the knowledge and capacities developed by governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent or current disasters'  . Yet, preparedness is also enveloped in and influenced by the socio-cultural dimension at the individual, organizational, and national levels, and measures to manage outbreaks are not always accepted or accommodated by the communities to which they are applied  . An analysis of eight European countries' preparedness plans since 2009 for countering a future influenza A (H1N1) pandemic revealed that the way plans were framed varied considerably, and '[told] us something about how the different countries want pandemics and preparedness to be understood by the public'  .\",\n",
       "  'More research was encouraged into cultural and social structures in the respective countries.In Iceland, information about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa came from several sources. The Directorate of Health (DH) first reported on the epidemic on 8 April 2014  . In Icelandic media, the rapid progress of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was increasingly highlighted, and exported Ebola cases to Spain, USA, and elsewhere, were widely covered. Fear of a global epidemic was rife, and in media and online discussions, doubts were raised about the Icelandic health system´s capacity to take care of a patient with Ebola    , despite its ranking as one of the best in the world  .On 11 August 2014, three days after WHO declared PHEIC because of Ebola, DH encouraged Icelandic citizens to avoid visits to the area, if possible, and reported that the national epidemic preparedness plan was being activated for Ebola  .',\n",
       "  'It was elaborated by a team that involved the Chief Epidemiologist at the DH, Landspitali University Hospital (LSH), the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management (DCPEM), and the seven Primary Healthcare Regional Organizations in the country at the time. Key external partners were the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO, in addition to Nordic collaborators in epidemic preparedness  . At the same time, it was regarded as highly unlikely that Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) would spread in the country  . Recognized scenarios included the possible appearance of an infected person in need of treatment, who could be either an Icelandic citizen who had visited or worked in one of the affected West African countries, or a person with signs of EVD on a trans-Atlantic flight in the navigation area controlled by Icelandic authorities     .',\n",
       "  'On 3 November 2014, the plan was put to the test when a foreign airline made a non-scheduled landing at Keflavík International Airport due to fear of EVD in one passenger from South Africa. Parked in a closed-off area, a physician in full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) entered the plane, but quickly ruled out Ebola  .Irrespective of good or bad overall performance, health systems are tested in times of crisis, such as epidemics. Here, the aim is to describe and analyse the process of establishing preparedness plans for Ebola in Iceland, with a specific focus on the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers involved in the process.This study is part of a larger study on the impact that the global threat of the Ebola epidemic had in Iceland [16, 27] . Qualitative case study methodology was applied, perceiving the preparedness planning and training process as the case with clear boundaries of the initiation, process, and wrap-up of preparedness planning and training.',\n",
       "  'The study was conducted in April-May 2016, and the interviewed participants were administrators and frontline health professionals central to the case, so as to explore their perspectives and experiences concerning Ebola preparedness [28, 29] . Staff in managerial positions were contacted by one of the authors (GG) for permission to interview them based on their role in the preparedness plan. To identify potential interviewees in the Ebola Treatment Team (ETT), the director of the team listed relevant email contacts. Those who responded positively were subsequently invited for an interview, conducted in Icelandic by one of the authors (ÍEH), a physiotherapist. In case interviewees suggested other potential participants, they were invited through email to participate. A similar methodology was applied to identify participants from the Emergency Room (ER).',\n",
       "  \"They were included in order to represent frontline health workers who worked in the only ER in Reykjavík, where persons exposed to EVD were most likely to first seek care in case of acute illness.Three separate interview guides were developedone each for managers, ETT, and ER respectively (see supplementary material). The interviews included open questions probing the role of their institution in preparedness, the experience of the training process, challenges encountered or expected, and any dilemmas that they may have experienced in relation to the preparedness plan. The recruitment of participants was concluded when saturation was reached. Each interview was recorded and took about 20 to 60 minutes; they were then transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. The data material was read through repeatedly, sorted, and categorized, based on the participants' priorities in the representation of their views.\",\n",
       "  \"From this exercise, three broad themes were inductively identified that corresponded to critical perspectives introduced by the participants.Permission to conduct the study was granted by Iceland's National Bioethics Committee (VSN- and Landspitali University Hospital (LSH 13-16, 4 February 2016) . Reporting on the results was guided by the COREC guidelines  ; however, to ensure anonymity of the respondents within the small community of staff who took part in the preparedness activities, participant information is not associated to quotations.The Icelandic Ebola Preparedness Plan included the establishment of an ETT within LSH  , and the preparatory activities engaged more than two hundred staff across all of its departments. The ETT consisted of about 50 healthcare professionals who had volunteered to participate, including 11 doctors and 28 nurses, a few laboratory technicians, radiologists, and auxiliary nurses. They attended special training sessions focused on protocols for admission and treatment of a patient with EVD, the donning/doffing of PPE, and personal protective measures during patient care.\",\n",
       "  \"A new provisory unit was designed to be set up on the ground floor to minimize the risk of infection spreading to other units within the hospital, with two rooms specifically identified for the care of a patient with EVD  .Managers' accounts of this period elaborated the complexity of preparedness planning in terms of the involved institutions, actors, procedures and requirement of the plan. One manager concluded:You get no discount. You can never go the shorter way. There was always something that surprised you. We thought this was a lot like a three headed monster, so when you chopped off one of its heads, three other emerged, every solution was followed by more problems.The health professionals who volunteered to join ETT did so for different reasons. Ebola preparedness was 'a job that had to be done', and 'someone had to do it'.\",\n",
       "  \"Some referred to ethical or professional obligations: This is just a part of being a nurse, to encounter situations that can be dangerous to you or someone else, but you have made this decision and you deal with it. Some connected their decision to their 'action gene' or 'addiction to taking risks', while others said they had already raised their kids and had years of experience, including work with other epidemics, such as HIV. Yet, the practice of volunteering in the preparation was questioned. One participant said:We learned that we could not rely on volunteers … when you work in an infectious disease department you cannot choose what infections you want to work with.ER staff indicated that for them working in the ER was enough of a risk to take, no reason to expose oneself even more by joining the ETT, and appreciated that others had volunteered.All participants noted that co-operation and communication had generally functioned well during the preparedness planning, with information flowing both ways.\",\n",
       "  'Short communication lines within the healthcare system were perceived as both a strength and a weakness; a strength, insofar as people knew each other, but a weakness because of the uneven burden of workload. Staff of the ETT and in the ER felt they had been well-informed, and that openness and honesty had characterized the planning and diminished their initial fear. Those in managerial positions had listened and taken their opinions into consideration. One said:They were honest, no one was hiding anything, everything was on the table, no one tried to make things more appealing and say that everything would be OK, they just told us about things as they were.Both management and participants from the ETT and ER expressed their ambiguity in terms of trust, doubt, and fear. Participants conveyed trust in the health system and their own role as health professionals, while at the same time admitting to facing formidable challenges during the elaboration of the preparedness plan.',\n",
       "  \"Facilities for isolation and treatment of patients with Ebola were less than perfect:We assessed how we could use the department … and change it in just a few hours into some kind of an isolation unit that we could possibly use.Some compared this short-term isolation facility to a 'camping site', as the facilities were too provisional and not comparable to those found elsewhere. There was also doubt about how many Ebola patients LSH would be able to care for: 'Maybe one or two patients, barely more'.Respondents believed that the training and education of the members of the ETT and ER had been satisfactory. They felt that it had been proportionate to the risk, while some were concerned about the lack of staff. Nonetheless, there were contradictions on the division of labour among the professionals, exemplified by different ideas on how to proceed if a patient suspected of having an EVD came in an ambulance to the LSH for treatment.\",\n",
       "  \"Almost all participants stated that they were ready to do their part in the Ebola response, or 'as ready as [we] could be'.There were diverse opinions on what it meant to be ready: to treat one confirmed case of Ebola, one suspected case, or more EVD patients? When asked if Ebola was a real threat to the country, participants usually referred to how easy it was to travel the globe: 'Yeah, why not, the world is getting smaller'. Although Ebola was thought of as a real danger by many, some participants expressed difficulty in taking their training seriously, doubting that Ebola would ever reach Iceland. One respondent said:People were dedicated in the beginning, but when the news appeared that Ebola was receding, that diminished, and I never felt like this formally ended.Participants described their relief that nothing really happened, while emphasizing the need to experience a real situation to evaluate the preparedness efforts.\",\n",
       "  'One participant said that \\'a little bit more seriousness [would have been] needed in the PPE practices\\'.It was taken as a manifestation of fear that some of the staff in the communicable disease department of the LSH refused to take part in the ETT. When describing their fears, ETT members frequently connected it to their working conditions. Many of them were afraid that they would not get the best PPE, others that they would not do the donning/doffing correctly and, lastly, they were worried about work performance while in the PPE. One participant said:What bothered most of us was how uncomfortable the PPE was and I think that made people nervous: \"How will I manage working in this for hours? \"Another described the donning/doffing process like a \\'complicated ballroom dance\\'. Moreover, participants were afraid of \\'unknown territories\\', that is, they did not know the hospital ward, they were supposed to work in, and some team members had no recent experience of clinical work.',\n",
       "  \"One participant said: I didn't think these [non-clinical] people belonged in the team, because this is a very clinical environment in addition to having to be in this costume [PPE] with the risk of becoming infected by mistake.Those with non-clinical background were, however, aware of their limitations: I realized that I would not be the one in the front, I would not be managing patients directly.The importance ascribed to teamwork was evident in relation to fear. Participants described fear of working with people they had not worked with before:The weakest link in the preparation was that even though I knew their faces, I had never worked with them.Another issue was no-show by some team members in training sessions or in lectures: This is team-work, one does this and the other one does this, [we] help each other.\",\n",
       "  \"Then you don't want to be working with someone who didn't show up.There were a lot of doctors who just dropped in, dropped out, and then dropped in again. I asked myself: Are these individuals … ready to take this on?Participants in the ETT mentioned the precautions they took or intended to take to cope with their feelings of fear, should Ebola emerge in Iceland. A major precaution was planning to avoid contact with the family while working with Ebola patients. One participant said: 'You thought … about your children at school … parents in the neighbourhood …' if they knew (s)he was working with an Ebola patient. For them, it was important they would have access to special accommodation in case of clinical EVD work 'so I wouldn't be exposing anyone or creating hysteria'. ETT members mentioned the extra insurance offered as a prerequisite for taking part in the team.\",\n",
       "  \"'The normal insurance for LHS staff would not cover everything if we were to become sick or even lose our lives.' Amongst ER staff, the matter of insurance did seem to be less of an issue compared to the ETT. One respondent said: 'You are used to being at risk by many disease threats'. Furthermore, the issue of higher salaries and risk commission came up in the interviews, but overall did not matter as much to the participants as the insurance, or assurance of accommodation in case of need.Characteristics associated with Iceland and the Icelandic people were referred to repeatedly by participants. The concept 'Tiny Iceland' was often mentioned and emerged with positive and negative connotations. 'Tiny Iceland' referred to the size of the country and population and its perceived capability to still 'get the job done'. even though compromises had to be made.\",\n",
       "  \"Comparing how Iceland handled its responsibilities differently from other countries of a larger size was often brought up, both with pride in Iceland as a strong independent nation, and with insecurities about its capacity in comparison to other countries. It was pointed out that since the preparedness process was in the hands of a few people, everyone knew their role. As one administrator said: This little hospital system, as complicated as it might seem every day, gives you the chance to just pick up the phone and call the one in charge.Being a small population presents challenges regarding resources, infrastructure, and specialized medical training to comply with standards of international actors. Notions of Icelanders as resilient in spite of shortcomings were common; referring to the experience of preparedness planning and training, one health staff said:It was very much the Icelandic way, we'll manage, we'll work it out, and there was so much ingenuity.\",\n",
       "  \"This notion of a particular Icelandic approach to coping, in spite of shortcomings, was also detected more generally, as in the statement:Would it have worked? Yes, it would have worked. Would it have been optimal? We cannot say, it would have been optimal; we can say, it would have been sufficient.In contrast to this, there were concerns about whether Icelandic aid workers falling ill in Ebolaaffected countries should be transferred to Iceland or to hospitals in other Nordic countries with better isolation units. Some of the participants trusted that patients with EVD would not be transferred to Iceland. One participant stated: You heard that Norwegians were criticized for transferring their aid worker from Africa to Norway. We don't know what would have happened if they would have transferred an Icelander into the country.We don't have good enough isolation unitsyou are not supposed to send patients to a hospital that is less than 100%.\",\n",
       "  'I thought there was assurance in that.During the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa that spread to neighbouring sub-Saharan countries, North America, and Europe  , preparedness plans were widely elaborated and later evaluated. Evaluations have, for example, been conducted in 11 African countries close to the epidemic  , in the EU region [34, 35] , and the US  . Here we present data from a qualitative case study on the process, and experiences with establishing a preparedness plan for Ebola in Iceland in 2014. Interviews with staff who were engaged, either as administrators or frontline healthcare workers, alert us to the manner in which geographic, demographic, cultural, and organizational characteristics shaped the response. The results show that the process of establishing and training for preparedness was permeated by ambiguities of pride and pragmatism, trust, doubts, and fear.',\n",
       "  \"'Getting the job done' (theme 1) refers to the multitude of tasks and considerations that surrounds and feeds into the preparedness plan itself and are necessary for successful planning and implementation. Using the metaphors of 'hard core' and 'soft periphery', Langley and Denis  emphasize the importance of relatively 'peripheral' concerns and processes for planning and implementation of new interventions. The hard core represents the actual intervention or goal, e.g. implementation of a preparedness plan. The soft periphery refers to all the contextually important networking, negotiations, and agreements necessary to deliver the hard core. If the soft periphery is neglected, it will cause multiple challenges in the implementation process, and the benefit of the hard core, the intervention itself, may not transpire as anticipated. Due attention to the soft periphery may, however, considerably promote the delivery of an innovation, and secure support from important stakeholders.\",\n",
       "  \"In our data, one manager speaks of the preparedness process as dealing with a three-headed monster where every solution was followed by new problems. The data indicate that the process of dealing with 'the three headed monster' was given due attention as a means to successfully develop Iceland's preparedness plan. Comprehensive consultations and the involvement of many associated institutions were mentioned. Still ambiguity remained with some staff in terms of division of responsibilities and taskse.g. when transporting a patient potentially infected with Ebola from the airport to the hospital, and other such activities.During epidemics, rumours, gossip, and unreliable information on the news and social media spread rapidly, resulting in so-called 'infodemics'  . The West African Ebola epidemic was covered widely by media  , and the fear of Ebola reached every corner of the world, exemplified by travel bans from affected countries, and trade barriers  , in contrast to the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo [41, 42] .\",\n",
       "  \"In our second theme, trust, doubt, and fear of health workers were represented. Although all intentions were good, concerns remained about the suitability and safety of the isolation ward, the PPE, and other tools, as well as adequate engagement of colleagues who might potentially work alongside them, in case an Ebola patient came to Iceland. The foreignness of putting on, removing, and working from within a PPE and the trustworthiness of available PPE were mentioned. In preparedness efforts in other countries, scarcity of resources in relation to manpower demand and problems with training and protocols involving PPE were common challenges  . Similar problems were encountered in Iceland. Provisory treatment facility had to be designed, called 'camping site' by some, in contrast to facilities found elsewhere  . Further, the ETT was established based on voluntary recruitment rather than on the staff's assigned roles within the healthcare system, a procedure that was deemed less than optimal.\",\n",
       "  'The members of the ETT pointed out that they had never worked together as a team under circumstances that demanded strict adherence to infectious control procedures. This eroded trust, compounded by the laissez-faire attitude of some of its members during the preparation exercises, possibly due to other competing tasks in a busy hospital and insufficient resources that hampered full participation  . Further, it was a constraint that simulation exercises were not an option, found to be an important element in preparation for epidemics  . This might have resulted in less than optimal staff protection for those who would have been in direct contact with an infected patient, as reported during the SARS epidemic in Canada [45, 46] .Anthropological work on emergency preparedness emphasizes the connectedness between health professionals, technological devices, and knowledge as a prerequisite for successful preparedness. Wolf and Hall present preparedness efforts as a form of governance that involves human bodies (those of health professionals), clinical architectures (e.g.',\n",
       "  \"isolation wards), and technical artefacts (gloves, protective suits, disinfectants, etc.)  . During preparedness training and implementation, 'nursing bodies are transformed into instruments of preparedness', and become part of infrastructural arrangements. Health professionals are, here, both vulnerable and powerful tools in the management of contamination. The authors argue that successful planning, training, and implementation of a preparedness plan require such intrinsic connectedness. In the case of Ebola preparedness in Iceland, health professionals draw our attention to dilemmas of connectedness, and their assessment of the fact that these shortcomings might hamper the mobilization of 'preparedness within the human body'that is, the embodied experience, routine, and tacit knowledge which Wolf and Hall state are key to successful implementation. Repeated enactment of receiving and treating a patient with Ebola within experienced and trustful teams would probably enhance such embodiment, provided that there is justified trust in the involved technology.\",\n",
       "  \"In addition, repetition would also strengthen the 'soft periphery' of preparedness, and divisions of responsibilities would be clearer manifested.In the third theme, we observe how notions of the 'Icelandic way' help participants make sense of ambiguities about Ebola preparedness. Loftsdóttir explored how people negotiated the imagination of the local and the global during the 2008 economic crisis in Iceland  . Notions of the intrinsic character of Iceland, and of being Icelandic, serve to underscore certain points and explain positive and negative experiences with the preparedness plan. Iceland is far away from the continents, but still connected through global needs for policy, risk of contamination, and dependency in terms of collaboration, in emergencies emerging from elsewhere. In our study, participants highlighted the importance of believing in oneself and the 'Icelandic way of doing things,' summed up in the paraphrase 'þetta reddast' (things always have a way of working out in the end).\",\n",
       "  \"The preparedness plan had to be completed, and adapted to Iceland's particular global situation.In the 21st century, the world has faced new epidemic threats, such as SARS, and old scourges such as the plague have resurfaced  . One of the main findings on Ebola preparedness measures in the EU was that measures taken were based on past preparedness and experience of other epidemics, such as SARS and H1N1  . Further, key stakeholders within each country found their measures to have been adequate for dealing with a single case of Ebola, as was the case in Iceland. A preparedness plan for pandemic influenzae in Iceland was elaborated in 2006activated in response to the H1N1 epidemic in 2009and revised in 2016  . During the elaboration of these plans, communication among the different levels of the healthcare system and supporting agencies, such as the DCPEM, had been clearly defined, and proved to be useful in the preparedness for Ebola.\",\n",
       "  'Further, as found important in preparedness activities for pandemic influenzae elsewhere  , honesty, transparency in communication, and sharing of information from managers to front-line health professionals, was found to be critical. It gave a feeling of being involved, and mitigated the fear that is so frequently encountered during epidemics  .Iceland was far away from the epicentre of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Yet this case study shows that health professionals felt the strain of possibly having to treat one or more patients with EVD. Their situation stands in sharp contrast to the situation in the three worst affected West African countries that lacked staff, stuff, space, and systems to effectively address the challenge of EVD. Although Icelandic health professionals had trust in the national healthcare system, and in their own capacity, doubt and fear influenced the reflections on preparedness planning of both administrators and healthcare staff.',\n",
       "  \"References to national identity and the characteristic of an 'Icelandic approach' to handling challenges assisted participants in coming to terms with the experienced shortcomings of the preparedness plan, and underscored the pride in the ingenuity applied in the process. These references negotiate the role and character of the nation of Iceland, and its role in a globalized world, as both a small and isolated nation on one hand, and a central and capable one, on the other.The experienced ambiguity needs attention in a health system and among healthcare staff that have to act resolutely and unfailingly, should they be placed in charge of containing contamination. This study points to the necessity of repeatedly re-enacting, as realistically as possible, the likely scenarios of receiving and treating one or more patients infected with Ebola (or other contagious global health threats) as a routine matter.\",\n",

       " ['Background As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       "  'Results The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.Text: On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January  .',\n",
       "  'It is reported that the virus might be bat origin  , and the transmission of the virus might related to a seafood market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) exposure [3, 4] . The genetic features and some clinical findings of the infection have been reported recently    . Potentials for international spread via commercial air travel had been assessed  . Public health concerns are being paid globally on how many people are infected and suspected.Therefore, it is urgent to develop a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility and dynamic of the transmission of the virus. There were several researches focusing on mathematical modelling [3, 8] . These researches focused on calculating the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate [3, 9, 10] , or using ordinary differential equations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods  .',\n",
       "  'However, the bat origin and the transmission route form the seafood market to people were not considered in the published models.In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model, and R 0 was calculated based on the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.The reported cases of SARS-CoV-2, which have been named as COVID-19, were collected for the modelling study from a published literature  . As reported by Li et al. , the onset date of the first case was on 7 December, 2020, and the seafood market was closed on 1 January, 2020  .',\n",
       "  'The epidemic curve from 7 December, 2019 to 1 January, 2020 was collected for our study, and the simulation time step was 1 day. fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, with tolerance set at 0.001, was used to perform curve fitting. While the curve fitting is in progress, Berkeley Madonna displays the root mean square deviation between the data and best run so far. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was employed to assess the goodness-of-fit. SPSS 13.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was employed to calculate the R 2 .The Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network modelThe BHRP transmission network model was posted to bioRxiv on 19 January, 2020  . We assumed that the virus transmitted among the bats, and then transmitted to unknown hosts (probably some wild animals). The hosts were hunted and sent to the seafood market which was defined as the reservoir of the virus.',\n",
       "  'People exposed to the market got the risks of the infection (Fig. 1) . The BHRP transmission network model was based on the following assumptions or facts:a) The bats were divided into four compartments: susceptible bats (S B ), exposed bats (E B ), infected bats (I B ), and removed bats (R B ). The birth rate and death rate of bats were defined as n B and m B . In this model, we set Ʌ B = n B × N B as the number of the newborn bats where N B refer to the total number of bats. The incubation period of bat infection was defined as 1/ω B and the infectious period of bat infection was defined as 1/γ B .',\n",
       "  'The S B will be infected through sufficient contact with I B , and the transmission rate was defined as β B . b) The hosts were also divided into four compartments: susceptible hosts (S H ), exposed hosts (E H ), infected hosts (I H ), and removed hosts (R H ). The birth rate and death rate of hosts were defined as n H and m H . In this model, we set Ʌ H = n H × N H where N H refer to the total number of hosts. The incubation period of host infection was defined as 1/ω H and the infectious period of host infection was defined as 1/γ H . The S H will be infected through sufficient contact with I B and I H , and the transmission rates were defined as β BH and β H , respectively.',\n",
       "  \"c) The SARS-CoV-2 in reservoir (the seafood market) was denoted as W. We assumed that the retail purchases rate of the hosts in the market was a, and that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the purchases was I H /N H , therefore, the rate of the SARS-CoV-2 in W imported form the hosts was aWI H /N H where N H was the total number of hosts. We also assumed that symptomatic infected people and asymptomatic infected people could export the virus into W with the rate of μ P and μ' P , although this assumption might occur in a low probability. The virus in W will subsequently leave the W compartment at a rate of εW, where 1/ε is the lifetime of the virus. d) The people were divided into five compartments:susceptible people (S P ), exposed people (E P ), symptomatic infected people (I P ), asymptomatic infected people (A P ), and removed people (R P ) including recovered and death people.\",\n",
       "  \"The birth rate and death rate of people were defined as n P and m P . In this model, we set Ʌ P = n P × N P where N P refer to the total number of people. The incubation period and latent period of human infection was defined as 1/ω P and 1/ω' P . The infectious period of I P and A P was defined as 1/γ P and 1/γ' P . The proportion of asymptomatic infection was defined as δ P . The S P will be infected through sufficient contact with W and I P , and the transmission rates were defined as β W and β P , respectively. We also assumed that the transmissibility of A P was κ times that of I P , where 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1.The parameters of the BHRP model were shown in Table 1 .We assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 might be imported to the seafood market in a short time.\",\n",
       "  'Therefore, we added the further assumptions as follows:a) The transmission network of Bats-Host was ignored. b) Based on our previous studies on simulating importation [13, 14] , we set the initial value of W as following impulse function:In the function, n, t 0 and t i refer to imported volume of the SARS-CoV-2 to the market, start time of the simulation, and the interval of the importation.Therefore, the BHRP model was simplified as RP model and is shown as follows:During the outbreak period, the natural birth rate and death rate in the population was in a relative low level. However, people would commonly travel into and out from Wuhan City mainly due to the Chinese New Year holiday. Therefore, n P and m P refer to the rate of people traveling into Wuhan City and traveling out from Wuhan City, respectively.In the model, people and viruses have different dimensions.',\n",
       "  'Based on our previous research  , we therefore used the following sets to perform the normalization:In the normalization, parameter c refers to the relative shedding coefficient of A P compared to I P . The normalized RP model is changed as follows:The transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 based on the RP modelIn this study, we used the R 0 to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Commonly, R 0 was defined as the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population [13, 16, 17] . If R 0 > 1, the outbreak will occur. If R 0 < 1, the outbreak will toward an end. In this study, R 0 was deduced from the RP model by the next generation matrix approach  .',\n",
       "  \"The multiple of the transmissibility of A P to that of I P .The parameters were estimated based on the following facts and assumptions:a) The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1-7.0)  . We set the same value (5.2 days) of the incubation period and the latent period in this study. Thus, ω P = ω' P = 0.1923. b) There is a mean 5-day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalized from 3 to 7 days after onset, respectively)    . The duration from illness onset to first medical visit for the 45 patients with illness onset before January 1 was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95% CI: 4.3-7.5)  . In our model, we set the infectious period of the cases as 5.8 days.\",\n",
       "  'Therefore, γ P = 0.1724. c) Since there was no data on the proportion of asymptomatic infection of the virus, we simulated the baseline value of proportion of 0.5 (δ P = 0.5). d) Since there was no evidence about the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, we assumed that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was 0.5 times that of symptomatic infection (κ = 0.5), which was the similar value as influenza  . We assumed that the relative shedding rate of A P compared to I P was 0.5. Thus, c = 0.5. e) Since 14 January, 2020, Wuhan City has strengthened the body temperature detection of passengers leaving Wuhan at airports, railway stations, long-distance bus stations and passenger terminals. As of January 17, a total of nearly 0.3 million people had been tested for body temperature  . In Wuhan, there are about 2.87 million mobile population  .',\n",
       "  'We assumed that there was 0.1 million people moving out to Wuhan City per day since January 10, 2020, and we believe that this number would increase (mainly due to the winter vacation and the Chinese New Year holiday) until 24 January, 2020. This means that the 2.87 million would move out from Wuhan City in about 14 days. Therefore, we set the moving volume of 0.2 million per day in our model. Since the population of Wuhan was about 11 million at the end of 2018  , the rate of people traveling out from Wuhan City would be 0.018 (0.2/11) per day. However, we assumed that the normal population mobility before January 1 was 0.1 times as that after January 10. Therefore, we set the rate of people moving into and moving out from Wuhan City as 0.0018 per day (n P = m P = 0.0018).f) The parameters b P and b W were estimated by fitting the model with the collected data.',\n",
       "  \"g) At the beginning of the simulation, we assumed that the prevalence of the virus in the market was 1/100000. h) Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could be stay for a longer time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market. We set ε = 0.1.In this study, we assumed that the incubation period (1/ ω P ) was the same as latent period (1/ω' P ) of human infection, thus ω P = ω' P . Based on the equations of RP model, we can get the disease free equilibrium point as: In the matrix:By the next generation matrix approach, we can get the next generation matrix and R 0 for the RP model: The R 0 of the normalized RP model is shown as follows:Our modelling results showed that the normalized RP model fitted well to the reported SARS-CoV-2 cases data (R 2 = 0.512, P < 0.001) (Fig.\",\n",
       "  '2) . The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person, and from person to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.In this study, we developed RP transmission model, which considering the routes from reservoir to person and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2 respectively. We used the models to fit the reported data in Wuhan City, China from published literature  . The simulation results showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.58 from person to person. There was a research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47-2.86)  . Another research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9)  . The different values might be due to the different methods.',\n",
       "  'The methods which Li et al. employed were based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval  . Our previous study showed that several methods could be used to calculate the R 0 based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, and different methods might result in different values of R 0  . Our results also showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person. This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. However, this result was based on the limited data from a published literature, and it might not show the real situation at the early stage of the transmission.Researches showed that the R 0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was about 2.7-3.4 or 2-4 in Hong Kong, China [27, 28] .',\n",
       "  'Another research found that the R 0 of SARS was about 2.1 in Hong Kong, China, 2.7 in Singapore, and 3.8 in Beijing, China  . Therefore, we believe that the commonly acceptable average value of the R 0 of SARS might be 2.9  . The transmissibility of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is much lower than SARS. The reported value of the R 0 of MERS was about 0.8-1.3  , with the inter-human transmissibility of the disease was about 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries  . However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the R 0 of 2.5-7.2 [33, 34] . Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea.To contain the transmission of the virus, it is important to decrease R 0 .',\n",
       "  'According to the equation of R 0 deduced from the simplified RP model, R 0 is related to many parameters. The mainly parameters which could be changed were b P , b W , and γ. Interventions such as wearing masks and increasing social distance could decrease the b P , the intervention that close the seafood market could decrease the b W , and shorten the duration form symptoms onset to be diagnosed could decrease 1/γ. All these interventions could decrease the effective reproduction number and finally be helpful to control the transmission.Since there are too many parameters in our model, several limitations exist in this study. Firstly, we did not use the detailed data of the SARS-CoV-2 to perform the estimation instead of using the data from literatures  .',\n",
       "  \"We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS. It is known that the proportion of asymptomatic infection of MERS and SARS was lower than 10%. Secondly, the parameters of population mobility were not from an accurate dataset. Thirdly, since there was no data of the initial prevalence of the virus in the seafood market, we assumed the initial value of 1/100 000. This assumption might lead to the simulation been under-or over-estimated. In addition, since we did not consider the changing rate of the individual's activity (such as wearing masks, increasing social distance, and not to travel to Wuhan City), the estimation of importation of the virus might not be correct. All these limitations will lead to the uncertainty of our results.\",\n",
       "  ' Therefore, the accuracy and the validity of the estimation would be better if the models fit the first-hand data on the population mobility and the data on the natural history, the epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism of the virus.By calculating the published data, our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea. Since the objective of this study was to provide a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the R 0 was estimated based on limited data which published in a literature. More data were needed to estimate the transmissibility accurately.'],\n",

Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human.

       "  'The disease spread to other countries where it primarily infected healthcare workers. One of these was Dr. Carlo Urbani, a WHO physician investigating a patient with the new disease in Hanoi. He recognized that the pneumonia was probably caused by a new, highly infectious agent, and rapidly notified the WHO. He contracted the SARS-CoV while there, became febrile and later died after traveling to Thailand to attend a conference. On 12 March 2003, WHO issued a global alert regarding the disease that was occurring primarily among health care workers in Hanoi, Vietnam and Hong Kong. The disease continued to spread, and by 31 July 2003 there were 8422 probable cases, leading to 916 deaths in 29 countries, with the majority of cases occurring in mainland China and Hong Kong. Approximately 30% of infections occurred in healthcare workers.',\n",
       "  'By the termination of the epidemic the global CFR was 11%  .Although there were relatively few documented cases of SARS occurring during pregnancy, several case reports and small clinical studies have described the clinical effects in pregnant women and their infants. In reviewing these reports describing pregnant women with SARS in China it is possible, and perhaps even probable, that some of the same patients were included in more than one publication. However, even if this is the case, there is no doubt that SARS coronavirus infection was found to be associated with severe maternal illness, maternal death, and spontaneous abortion [19,     . Martha Anker, an expert in statistics formerly with the WHO and the University of Massachusetts, estimated that more than 100 cases of SARS-CoV infection occurred in pregnant women, which warrants closer inspection  .The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong were worse than those occurring in infected women who were not pregnant  .',\n",
       "  'Wong et al. evaluated the obstetrical outcomes from a cohort of pregnant women who developed SARS in Hong Kong during the period of 1 February to 31 July 2003. Four of the 7 women (57%) that presented during the 1st trimester sustained spontaneous miscarriages, likely a result of the hypoxia that was caused by SARS-related acute respiratory distress. Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).A case-control study to determine the effects of SARS on pregnancy compared 10 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women with the infection at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong [27, 33] . There were 3 deaths among the pregnant women with SARS (maternal mortality rate of 30%) and no deaths in the non-pregnant group of infected women (P = 0.006). Renal failure (P = 0.006) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (P = 0.006) developed more frequently in pregnant SARS patients when compared with the non-pregnant SARS group.',\n",
       "  'Six pregnant women with SARS required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (60%) and 4 required endotracheal intubation (40%), compared with a 12.5% intubation rate (P = 0.065) and 17.5% ICU admission rate (P = 0.012) in the non-pregnant group.Maxwell et al. reported 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV who were followed at a designated SARS unit-2 of the 7 died (CFR of 28%), and 4 (57%) required ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. In contrast, the mortality rate was less than 10% and mechanical ventilation rate less than 20% among non-pregnant, age-matched counterparts who were not infected with SARS-CoV. Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR. Among the live newborn infants, none had clinical or laboratory evidence for SARS-CoV infection. The new mothers who had developed SARS were advised not to breastfeed to prevent possible vertical transmission of the virus.Zhang et al.',\n",

Two of the mothers became infected in the 2nd trimester, and 3 developed infection in the 3rd trimester. Two of the pregnant women had hospital-acquired SARS infections, and the other 3 were community-acquired. All 5 pregnant women had fever and abnormal chest radiographs; 4 had cough; 4 developed hypoalbuminemia; 3 had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT), 3 had chills or rigor, 2 had decreased lymphocytes, and 2 had decreased platelets. One pregnant woman required intensive care, but all recovered and there were no maternal deaths. The 5 infants were clinically evaluated, and none had evidence of SARS.Two pregnant women with SARS were reported from the United States. In a detailed case report, Robertson et al. described a 36-year-old pregnant woman with an intermittent cough of approximately 10 days duration and no fever.',\n",
       "  'While travelling in Hong Kong during the 2003 epidemic, she was exposed at her hotel to a person subsequently known to be infected with SARS-CoV. At 19 weeks gestation she developed fever, anorexia, headache, increasing cough, weakness, and shortness of breath. Upon returning to the United States she was hospitalized with pneumonia. Obstetrical ultrasounds revealed a low-lying placenta (placenta previa) but were otherwise normal. Following her discharge home and clinical recovery, she was found to have antibodies to SARS-CoV. She underwent cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation because of the placenta previa and a healthy baby girl was delivered [35, 36] . The placenta was interpreted as being normal. At 130 days post-maternal illness, maternal serum and whole blood, swabs from maternal nasopharynx and rectum, post-delivery placenta, umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, and breast milk were collected for analysis-no viral RNA was detected in specimens tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).',\n",
       "  'Antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected from maternal serum, umbilical cord blood, and breast milk by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay. No clinical specimens (except for cord blood) were available for testing from the infant. The second case in the USA occurred in a 38-year-old woman who had travelled to Hong Kong at 7 weeks gestation where she was exposed to SARS-CoV in the same hotel as the aforementioned American woman  . Following her return to the United States, her husband developed the clinical onset of SARS, and 6 days later she became ill with fever, myalgia, chills, headache, coryza, and a productive cough with shortness of breath and wheezing. Following her hospitalization for SARS she recovered, serum samples taken on days 28 and 64 post-onset of illness were positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV by enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescent assays. Her pregnancy continued and was unremarkable except for developing elevated glucose levels.',\n",
       "  \"A cesarean section that was performed at 36 weeks gestation due to preterm rupture of membranes and fetal distress resulted in a healthy baby boy. At the time of delivery, the mother's serum samples were positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV, but samples taken of umbilical cord blood and placenta were negative. Breast milk sampled 12 and 30 days after delivery were also negative for SARS-CoV antibodies. Specimens evaluated from maternal blood, stool, and nasopharynx samples, as well as umbilical cord blood of the infant, were all negative for coronavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Neonatal stool samples obtained on days-of-life 12 and 30 were also negative for viral RNA.From Canada, Yudin et al. reported a 33-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to the hospital at 31 weeks gestation with a fever, dry cough, and abnormal chest radiograph demonstrating patchy infiltrates. She had acquired SARS from contact with an infected family member.\",\n",
       "  'Following a 21-day stay in the hospital, during which she did not require ventilatory support, her convalescent antibody titers were positive for coronavirus infection. She had a normal labor and delivery and her newborn girl had no evidence of infection.In a study of 5 liveborn neonates who were delivered to women infected with SARS-CoV during the Hong Kong epidemic, results from multiple tests-including serial RT-PCR assays, viral culture, and paired neonatal serological titers-were negative for SARS-CoV  . None of the 5 neonates developed any clinical signs or symptoms of respiratory infection or compromise.Fortunately, there were no cases of vertical transmission identified among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV during the 2002-2003 Asian epidemic [27, 30, 31, 39, 40] , and with the exception of a small cluster of cases that recurred in late 2003, no new cases of SARS have occurred.In the only reported study of the placental pathology of mothers with SARS, Ng et al.',\n",
       "  'reported the findings from 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV. In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal. Three placentas were delivered from pregnancies in which the mothers had acute SARS-CoV infection-these were abnormal and demonstrated increased subchorionic and intervillous fibrin, a finding that can be associated with abnormal maternal blood flow to the placenta. In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal. They showed extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy with areas of avascular chorionic villi-chronic findings of fetal vascular malperfusion. These 2 pregnancies also were complicated by oligohydramnios and had poor obstetrical outcomes-both infants had developed IUGR.',\n",
       "  'It is interesting that villitis, the microscopic finding of inflammation of the chorionic villi that is the histologic hallmark of many maternal hematogenous infections that are transmitted through the placenta to the fetus, was not identified in any of these placentas.Similar to other coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV is easily spread from person-to-person via respiratory droplets and secretions as well as through nosocomial contacts [42, 43] . In addition to transmission of SARS-CoV through natural aerosols from infected patients, it was found that in Hong Kong the SARS-CoV could also be transmitted by mechanical aerosols  . Environmental factors had an important role when it was discovered that during the Amoy Gardens housing estate outbreak as many as two-thirds of infected persons had diarrhea, SARS-CoV was excreted in their stools, and that aerosols arising from the flushing of toilets could transmit the virus  .',\n",
       "  'Healthcare facilities were also an important source of new SARS infections during the 2002-2003 epidemic, and healthcare workers were also at high risk for acquiring the infection.In order to address the safety issues for the obstetrical management and delivery of pregnant women with SARS, guidelines were prepared by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada  . These recommendations include:1. \"All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit.At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for symptoms of and risk factors for SARS.Upon arrival in the labour triage unit, pregnant patients with suspected and probable SARS should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour.',\n",
       "  \"All labour and delivery units caring for suspected and probable SARS should have available at least one room in which patients can safely labour and deliver while in need of airborne isolation.If possible, labour and delivery (including operative delivery or Caesarean section) should be managed in a designated negative pressure isolation room, by designated personnel with specialized infection control preparation and protective gear. 5.Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS.Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother's period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period. 7.A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols.\",\n",
       "  '8.Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient. 9.All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus. 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centers, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses. \"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first reported in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, following isolation of MERS-CoV from a male patient who died months earlier from severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure  .',\n",
       "  'In the 8 years since then, there have been more than 2494 confirmed cases of MERS resulting in upwards of 858 deaths globally  . While 27 countries have reported cases of MERS, approximately 80% of confirmed cases originated in Saudi Arabia  . To date, all known cases of MERS can be linked to travel or residence in countries along the Arabian Peninsula-that is, Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar, Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen  . The largest documented outbreak outside of this region occurred in 2015 in the Republic of Korea, in which 186 infections occurred, resulting in 38 deaths  . The index case in this outbreak reportedly returned from the Arabian Peninsula just prior to onset of illness  .MERS-CoV is characterized by sporadic zoonotic transmission events as well as spread between infected patients and close contacts (i.e., intra-familial transmission)  .',\n",
       "  'Nosocomial outbreaks in health care settings-the result of poor infection control and prevention-are widely recognized as the hallmark of MERS  . Superspreading events have been recorded in healthcare settings in Jordan, Al Hasa, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi and South Korea [47,     . Like other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV can be spread through person-to-person contact, likely via infected respiratory secretions  . Transmission dynamics, however, are otherwise poorly understood  . Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and dromedary camels can have the virus and have been suggested as possible intermediary hosts as well as a source of infection to humans [2, 56, 57] .There are no clinical or serological reports of perinatal transmission of MERS, though vertical transmission has been reported for non-coronavirus respiratory viruses including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  .',\n",
       "  'Researchers have not yet discovered ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV within communities outside of health care settings.The clinical presentation of MERS varies from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ failure, often resulting in death. Most patients with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness accompanied by fever, cough, and shortness of breath  . Progression to pneumonia is swift-usually within the first week -and at least one-third of patients also present with gastrointestinal symptoms  . MERS progresses much more rapidly to respiratory failure and has a higher case fatality rate than SARS  . Unlike SARS, however, infection with MERS-CoV is generally mild in healthy individuals but more severe in immunocompromised patients and people with underlying comorbidities  . The overall CFR of MERS is approximately 34.4%  . Most fatalities have been associated with pre-existing medical conditions like chronic lung disease, diabetes, and renal failure, as well as weakened immune systems  , making such individuals high risk.',\n",
       "  'As a result of the immunological changes that occur during pregnancy, women who are pregnant are included in this high-risk group. Pregnant women may develop severe disease and fatal maternal and/or fetal outcomes as a result of MERS-CoV infection; however, little is known of the pathophysiology of this infection during pregnancy.Limited data exists on the prevalence and clinical features of MERS during pregnancy, birth, and the postnatal period. It is likely, however, that the immunological changes that normally occur in pregnancy may alter susceptibility to the MERS-CoV and the severity of clinical illness  . Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy. To date, however, very few pregnancy-associated cases (n = 11) have been documented, with 91% having adverse clinical outcomes.Between November 2012 and February 2016, there were 1308 cases of MERS reported by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MoH).',\n",
       "  'Of these, 5 patients were pregnant, according to a retrospective study by Assiri et al. , and all resulted in adverse outcomes. Patient ages ranged from 27 to 34 years, with occurrence of exposure in either the 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 5 cases received intensive care. Two women died and there were 2 cases of perinatal death-1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death shortly after emergency cesarean section. These instances of severe maternal and perinatal outcomes are consistent with other reports of MERS-CoV infection in pregnant women, as well as outcomes associated with SARS-CoV infection. The authors of the retrospectives study concede that unreported cases of MERS in pregnancy are likely due to lack of routine pregnancy testing  . They conclude that pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age should be considered for those who test positive for MERS-CoV, to contribute to overall understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiological risk.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, 2 of the 5 patients were healthcare workers, which corresponds with existing knowledge of higher risk of exposure to MERS-CoV in healthcare settings.In a separate case report of MERS occurring in pregnancy, Alserehi et al. described a 33-year-old critical care nurse who became infected during the 3rd trimester in the midst of a large hospital outbreak. In the days following hospital admission, she developed respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and administration of dexamethasone as prophylaxis for the fetus. Following an emergency cesarean section at 32 weeks gestation, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and later recovered. The preterm but otherwise healthy infant was kept in the neonatal unit for observation and later released along with his mother. In contrast to other reported cases, this patient had a successful outcome, perhaps due to the timing of MERS-CoV exposure, her young age, the use of steroids, and differences in immune response.Alfaraj et al.',\n",
       "  'described 2 cases of maternal infection with MERS-CoV at the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital (PMAH) in Saudi Arabia. Maternal infection in both cases was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab testing by RT-PCR. One patient was a 29-year-old woman at 6 weeks gestation with no underlying medical conditions. The second patient, a 39-year-old at 24 weeks gestation, had several comorbidities, including end stage renal disease, hypertension, and hemodialysis. This woman presented to the hospital after contact with a MERS-CoV-infected person during an active outbreak. Both patients later tested negative for MERS-CoV and were subsequently discharged. The younger patient delivered a healthy, full-term infant. The status of the other delivery is unknown. Neither fetus was tested for MERS-CoV.According to Payne et al. , epidemiologic investigation of the 2012 MERS outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan, revealed that a 2nd trimester stillbirth (5 months gestational age) had occurred as a result of maternal exposure to MERS-CoV.',\n",
       "  'The mother experienced fever, fatigue, headache and cough, concurrently with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. On the 7th day of symptoms, she had a fetal death. The mother was confirmed to have antibody to MERS-CoV, and she self-reported having had unprotected contact with family members who later tested positive for the virus. This was the first documented occurrence of stillbirth during maternal infection with MERS-CoV.On 24 November 2013, a 32-year-old pregnant woman in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) developed ARDS following admission to the ICU after suspected community-acquired pneumonia advanced to respiratory failure and hypotension  . Later that day, her baby was delivered by caesarean section and subsequent Apgar scores were within healthy range. The next day, RT-PCR evaluation revealed that the mother was positive for MERS-CoV. Despite rigorous intervention, including oral ribavirin-peginterferon-α therapy and ventilator support, the woman continued to deteriorate, developed septic shock, and died.',\n",
       "  'While the outcome for this mother was fatal, Malik et al. noted that virus shedding ceased during therapy with ribavirin and peginterferon-α and radiographic evidence indicated clinical improvement before her death  . More research is needed to determine safety, efficacy, and dosage of these therapies in the general population but also in pregnant women. While few data exist on the effects of these treatments in pregnant humans, ribavirin is generally contraindicated during pregnancy  .Outside of the Middle East the only confirmed case of MERS in pregnancy occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Jeong et al. reported that a 39-year-old patient was exposed during the 3rd trimester following contact with a patient having MERS. Despite abrupt vaginal bleeding and rupture of membranes, the patient recovered fully and delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks and 5 days gestation.',\n",
       "  \"Subsequent testing of the infant's blood did not detect any IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies to MERS-CoV.The mean maternal age of the 11 confirmed maternal SARS cases described above was 33.2 years, with a mean gestational age of 26.3 weeks. The source of infection in 2 of the cases was attributed to contact with family members who tested positive for MERS-CoV, unknown in 3 cases, likely due to animal exposure in 1 case, and 6 were healthcare-associated (2 of these patients were healthcare workers). Six patients required intensive care and 3 died. Of those who died, 2 were exposed to MERS-CoV in the 3rd trimester, and 1 was exposed during the 2nd trimester. The infant death rate for all 11 cases was 27%. Fetal survival did not appear to correlate with the timing of maternal infection and gestational age; however, more data are needed to draw conclusions about this relationship.\",\n",
       "  'According to Alfaraj et al. , the CFR for the 11 infected women-also 27%-was not statistically different from the overall CFR of MERS in the general population (35%) (P = 0.75). Only 1 case resulted in both maternal and fetal death.Similar to SARS in pregnancy, more research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of MERS in pregnancy including the relationship between the timing of maternal infection, gestational age of the fetus, the effects of comorbid factors, and the occurrence of adverse outcomes. Few studies documented the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the umbilical cord or neonatal blood, making it difficult to assess perinatal transmission. As such, future studies should involve the collection of samples from relevant specimens including amniotic fluid, placenta, and umbilical cord  .MERS prevention should be high priority for high-risk exposures such as healthcare workers, pregnant women and individuals working with camels, camel meat-milk processors and in abattoirs  .',\n",
       "  'Since 2013, the Saudi Arabia MoH has recommended that pregnant women postpone travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj and Umrah  . To further reduce risk of exposure among pregnant women, additional measures such as avoiding contact with camels and sick persons-particularly in healthcare settings-are also recommended. Pregnant women who present with symptoms of pneumonia, influenza-like illness (ILI), or sepsis on the Arabian Peninsula may also benefit from MERS-CoV screening to expedite early diagnosis and improve disease management  .While multiple agents have been used to treat MERS, none have been tested in large clinical studies. Available data are limited to the use of combination therapies of interferon and other agents in case reports and case series  . A prospective or randomized study may prove difficult given the sporadic nature of MERS-CoV outbreaks.Due to a gap in research on the treatment of MERS in pregnancy, there are no therapeutic options currently recommended for pregnant women  .',\n",
       "  'Therapies under development and testing may be considered inappropriate for pregnant women due to the unknown potential for teratogenic effects. For example, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, ribavirin was administered to pregnant women with severe cases of the disease, but ribavirin therapy has been documented to increase the risk of teratogenic effects in newborns  .The Alphacoronaviruses HCoV 229E and NL63, as well as the Betacoronaviruses HKU 1 and OC43, can infect humans and cause the common cold. In order to investigate the potential maternal-fetal transmission of human coronaviruses during pregnancy, Gagneur et al. [64, 65] evaluated 3 types of maternal-infant paired specimens that included maternal vaginal and respiratory specimens that were obtained during labor, as well as gastric samples from the newborn infants. These specimens were evaluated for the presence of HCoV 229E, OC-43, NL63 and HKU 1 using RT-PCR methodology. Between the period from July 2003 to August 2005 the authors examined 159 mother-infant dyads.',\n",
       "  'Human coronaviruses were identified in 12 samples (HCoV 229E: 11; HKU 1 : 1) from 7 mother-child pairs. In 3 mother-infant dyads only maternal respiratory samples were positive; in 2 other pairs all 3 of the samples tested positive for human coronavirus; in 1 case only the maternal vaginal and newborn gastric samples were positive; and in another case the maternal vaginal sample alone was positive. There were no signs of clinical infection in any of the 3 neonates that had positive gastric samples for human coronavirus.It is beyond the scope of this communication to discuss the various technical challenges inherent in developing a safe and efficacious vaccine for coronavirus infections in humans.',\n",
       "  'There are clearly challenges to this endeavor-protective antibodies to coronaviruses are not long-lasting, tissue damage has been reported to occur as a result of exposure to SARS-CoV, development of animal models that closely resemble human infection are limited, and the extensive time and expense necessary to perform clinical trials in humans, to name a few    .It is vitally important that pregnant women be considered in the design, clinical trial, and implementation of vaccine candidates for 2019-nCoV. In examining the history of vaccine design, it is clear that the needs of pregnant women have rarely been prioritized in either the preclinical development or the clinical trial phases of production. Today, pregnant women are usually excluded from experimental trial of drugs and vaccines that do not target obstetric conditions  .',\n",
       "  'Excluding pregnant women and their infants from participation in vaccine development and implementation undermines ethical principles of justice-fairness, equity, and maximization of benefit-and potentially places their health at risk during outbreaks and other health emergencies    .On 23 January 2020 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced three programs to develop a vaccine against the novel Wuhan coronavirus. The Chief Executive Officer of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said  :\"Given the rapid global spread of the nCoV-2019 virus the world needs to act quickly and in unity to tackle this disease. Our intention with this work is to leverage our work on the MERS coronavirus and rapid response platforms to speed up vaccine development. \"The novel coronavirus is the first epidemic disease to emerge since the formation of CEPI in Davos in 2017. CEPI was created with the express intent to enable speedy research and development of vaccines against emerging pathogens.',\n",
       "  'In May 2017, WHO released the Target Product Profile (TPP) for MERS-CoV vaccines, following the prioritization of MERS-CoV as one of eight priority pathogens for prevention of epidemics  . CEPI and partners aim to use existing platforms-that is, the existing \"backbone\" that can be adapted for use against new pathogens-that are currently in preclinical development for MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. Following the WHO declaration on 30 January that the current 2019-nCoV outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), global health organizations and researchers will be further mobilized-bolstered by new mechanisms for action and greater resources-to stop the spread of disease.A critical question that must be answered at this stage-with a clear view of the potential deleterious effects of a new coronavirus in pregnancy-is will maternal immunization be a priority in research and development? As of the PHEIC declaration, 12 groups have announced that they are developing new vaccines against 2019-nCoV and seven others announced initiatives to develop new therapies  .',\n",
       "  \"Safe testing of experimental vaccines in a pregnant population is difficult and, as a result, vaccines are not typically developed with pregnant women in mind. To date, very few clinical trials for vaccines have proactively included pregnant women  , and the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from receiving the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through 3 Ebola virus epidemics serves as a recent example    . Given the potential severity in pregnancy, as demonstrated by this review of maternal infections of SARS and MERS, women who are pregnant should be considered a priority population in all efforts to prepare for and prevent infection by novel coronaviruses.On 5 February 2020 it was reported by multiple media outlets that a newborn infant delivered during the epidemic in Wuhan had tested positive for 2019-nCoV at the Wuhan Children's Hospital in Hubei Province 30 hours following its birth.\",\n",
       "  'According to the official Xinhua news agency, the infant was delivered on 2 February to a mother who had tested positive for the virus. Reports have stated that the infant had stable vital signs, no fever or cough, but had shortness of breath together with abnormal chest radiographs and abnormalities of liver function    . Dr. Zeng Lingkong, Chief Physician at the Neonatal Medicine Department of the hospital, said  , \"This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission\"The hospital also provided information about a previous case of a baby that had been delivered on 13 January 2020. Following its birth, the infant\\'s nanny was diagnosed with 2019-nCoV, and the mother was diagnosed days later  . On 29 January the baby began to develop symptoms. According to Dr. Zeng Lingkong  , \"Whether it was the baby\\'s nanny who passed the virus to the mother who passed it to the baby, we cannot be sure at the moment.',\n",
       "  'But we can confirm that the baby was in close contact with patients infected with the new coronavirus, which says newborns can also be infected\"In considering whether these and future cases of neonatal infection are acquired prior to delivery, it is important to remember that newborn infants can acquire an infection in other ways beyond intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission. In some cases, viral infection can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during a vaginal delivery or through post-partum breast feeding, although these mechanisms would be highly unusual for a respiratory virus. Neonatal infection from respiratory viruses can occur after delivery through such mechanisms as inhalation of the agent through aerosols produced by coughing from the mother, relatives or healthcare workers or other sources in the hospital environment. Based upon past experience with pregnant women who developed MERS and SARS, and realizing that the numbers are limited, there has never been confirmed intrauterine coronavirus transmission from mother to fetus.',\n",
       "  'Discussing the most recent baby to be diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV infection, Dr. Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University stated  , \"It\\'s more likely that the baby contracted the virus from the hospital environment, the same way healthcare workers get infected by the patients they treat,\" \"It\\'s quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally-by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing. \"And according to Dr. Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia  , \"As far as I am aware there is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted in the womb. When a baby is born vaginally it is exposed to the mother\\'s gut microbiome, therefore if a baby does get infected with coronavirus a few days after birth we currently cannot tell if the baby was infected in the womb or during birth.',\n",
       "  '\"There is limited knowledge regarding coronavirus infections that occur during pregnancy-what is known has, for the most part, been the result of epidemics resulting from two different diseases, SARS and MERS. These previous experiences with coronavirus infections in pregnancy indicates that these agents are capable of causing adverse clinical outcomes including life-threatening maternal disease that in some cases requires hospitalization, intensive care and ventilatory support. Both of these coronaviruses can result in maternal death in a small but significant number of cases, but the specific risk factors for a fatal outcome during pregnancy have not been clarified. Coronaviruses can also result in adverse outcomes for the fetus and infant including intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, admission to the ICU, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. Unlike some viral infections, notably Ebola virus  and Zika virus  , the likelihood of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission of coronaviruses is low-there have been no documented cases of vertical transmission occurring with either SARS or MERS.',\n",
       "  ' It remains to be seen during the current Wuhan 2019-nCoV epidemic how this newly-emergent coronavirus affects pregnant women and their infants, as well as which factors may modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal coronavirus exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables. However, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Additional clinical research on the treatment of SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is necessary if we are to understand the potential risks and benefits of novel therapies and new vaccines in pregnancy. This research will be critical in improving the care, and even saving the lives, of pregnant women in the current as well as future outbreaks.'],\n",

The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively.',\n",

The primary case remains unknown, but the index case, defined as the first identified case, is a passenger who started coughing from 19 January 2020 on board, disembarking the ship in Hong Kong on 25 January. As the case was diagnosed on 1 February, the ship was requested to remain in the ocean near Yokohama from 3 February onwards. Subsequently, the movement of all passengers was restricted on board from 5 February, for a matter of 14 days of quarantine.',\n",

For this reason, the time of infection needs to be statistically estimated, employing a backcalculation method  . Using a sophisticated statistical model with doubly intervalcensored likelihood and right truncation with an exponential growth of cases, the mean incubation period has been estimated to be about 5.0 days  . To understand the time-dependent risk of infection throughout the course of outbreak and estimate the effectiveness of the quarantine measure from 5 to 19 February 2020, I aimed to estimate the incidence of infection with COVID-19 and also predict the likely number of infections prevented by the quarantine measure.I analyzed the epidemic curve, ct, on day t, illustrated by the number of confirmed cases by the date of illness onset.',\n",
       "  'The confirmatory diagnosis was made, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The date of illness onset was defined as the first date of fever. In addition to the date of illness onset, cases were classified by contact history inside the cabin and also by the type of membership, i.e., crew or passenger. Close contact was defined as having at least one cabinmate who was confirmed by RT-PCR.We estimate the number of cases by time of infection, it. Using the probability mass function of the incubation period of length s, fs, the incidence of infection is known to satisfywhere E(.) represents the expected value. As for fs, it is known that the mean and standard deviation are 5.0 and 3.0 days, respectively, best fitted by lognormal distribution  .

Assuming that the cumulative incidence is Gaussian distributed, four unknown parameters were estimated. The Richards model was fitted to two different datasets, i.e., (i) the dataset of the entire course of the epidemic and (ii) the dataset by 4 February 2020. The latter dataset corresponds to the time period without any impact of movement restriction that was in place from 5 February onwards.',\n",

The second dominating group was passengers with close contact history. The last illness onset date on board of a passenger without close contact was on 14 February. Estimating the incidence of infection, the peak incidence was identified for the period from 2 to 4 February among passengers both with and without close contact (Figure 2 ). The incidence of infection abruptly dropped after 5 February, the date of movement restriction. Among passengers without close contact, the incidence was estimated to be zero, except for 8-10 February 2020, during which 0.98 persons (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0, 7.74) per day were estimated to have been infected.',\n",

The most plausible number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.Text: Since the announcement of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was made on 31 December 2019, many rapid virological, clinical, and epidemiological research responses have taken place [1, 2] .

In early January, the outbreak began to escalate rapidly with hundreds of cases now confirmed along with the presence of a few household clusters     .As of 24 January 2020, the cumulative incidence in China is 830 cases, of which 549 cases were diagnosed in Hubei, 26 in Beijing, 20 in Shanghai, and 53 in Guangdong.',\n",

Table 1 shows the incidence of exported cases by date of hospitalization and report. Due to the initial difficulty of diagnosis in the absence of established primer for polymerase chain reaction testing, the time lag between hospitalization and reporting was longer for early cases compared with that of more recent cases.',\n",

Two other locations with confirmed cases, i.e., Macau and Hong Kong, were excluded from the analysis, because it is commutable by land transporation and the first case in Hong Kong was indeed not via airtravel. As we already know from elsewhere    , given the observed cumulative count of c exported cases, we have a balance equation of the cumulative risk of infection:where T is the sum of incubation and infectious periods, and here is assumed to be 3.2 and 9.3 days  , respectively, assuming that these periods are similar to those of other coronaviruses, and thus, T = 12.5 days.',\n",

This encourages the real-time release of information by means of regularly updated situation reports, including epidemiological information with dates of exposure, illness onset, and hospitalization among cases.For researchers to be able to contribute to control efforts by improving situation awareness via an explicit risk assessment, it is crucial that detailed epidemiological data are posted to a public domain in real-time.',\n",

In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics. Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow. Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research.',\n",

In the USA, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause substantial mortality especially among people aged 65 and older  .However, although deaths in the industrialised world are widely reported, developing countries feel the burden particularly; out of an estimated 1.9 million child deaths from ARIs in 2000, 70% of those deaths occurred in Africa and south-east Asia  .',\n",

After HRVs, coronaviruses (CoV), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the next most frequent.More recently an evaluation of illness in 6,266 children under ten years of age in Australia, South East Asia and Latin America emphasised both the viral heterogeneity and the impact of ARI.',\n",

HRV infections throughout the year and in many cases, manifest with symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. HRV is known to be the primary cause of ARI and a severe contributing factor in exacerbations of atopic disease, e.g., asthma as well other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)     .HRV infections are associated with significant economic implications as well as being an important contributor to sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis and primary pneumonia    .

Many deaths are due to suboptimal long-term medical care and delay in obtaining help during severe exacerbations of the disease  . Treatments to prevent worsening of symptoms and other therapies for mild to moderate asthma that avert relapse, i.e., the symptoms worsen again when the treatment stops, are significant unmet medical needs.The human challenge model has been used to investigate the viral pathogenicity      and recent publications on the asthma challenge model have focused on how the asthmatic host responds to HRV infection.',\n",

Impaired host responses to virus infection, a better understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal immune responses and the potential to develop novel therapeutic targets for virus-induced exacerbations have all used the HVC model [12,     .Despite previous research work on multiple small molecule antivirals, such as pleconaril which have been tested using both the experimental challenge model and field studies    , there is currently no licensed treatment for HRV infections Other compounds have been tested against HRV, such as Vapendavir (BTA798) which prevented the release of viral RNA into the target cell and demonstrated a reduction in peak viral load in the HVC model  .',\n",

Rupintrivir was well tolerated and reduced viral loads and respiratory symptoms  .

A World Health Organization (WHO) global pooled analysis of 70,000 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised H1N1 pandemic patients from 19 countries revealed that of the 9,700 patients admitted to intensive care units, 2,500 died, and that morbid obesity might be a risk factor for hospitalisation and/or death  . Obesity was confirmed as a factor associated with a higher likelihood of admission to hospital in influenzainfected patients  .The 2009 pandemic was considered mild.

The problem of ensuring that the seasonal vaccine is correctly matched to the upcoming circulating strain highlights the need for rapid development of inter-seasonal/universal vaccines and also the need for a way of testing their efficiency rapidly and accurately before the lengthy and expensive mass production is engaged which takes many months [66, 67] .Antiviral drugs exist of which currently the NA inhibitor oseltamivir is most commonly used. This is active against all known NA subtypes of influenza, and one would, therefore, assume against all influenza strains.

No isolates were resistant to zanamivir  . Although animal studies have demonstrated limited transmission of mutant viruses [70, 71] , it is thought that the rise of oseltamivir resistance may be due to community transmission [72, 73] rather than the H275Y mutation becoming fixed in the viral genome.Asystematic systematic review and meta-analysis of published data from 2000 onwards concluded that most RSV-associated child deaths occur particularly in preterm infants and in infants up to 1-year of age [62, 74] .\",\n",

Although assessing the overall contribution of bacteria to disease severity is complicated by the presence of many confounding factors in clinical studies, understanding the role of viral/bacterial co-infections in defining the outcome of paediatric ARI may potentially reveal novel treatment and prevention strategies, improving patient outcomes [33,           .A recent (2017) publication considered the role of bacterial colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis during symptomatic and asymptomatic viral upper respiratory infection in the nasopharynx of 4 to 7-year-old children during URI and when well.',\n",
       "  'Using a multiplex PCR, virus was detected in about 80% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in children and is also detectable in the nasopharynx of 30% of asymptomatic children. All three bacteria \"levels\" were higher during acute URI visits compared to asymptomatic surveillance visits by the children. Of note, however, is that even during asymptomatic follow-up visits, if the virus was present, all bacteria were detected at higher levels  .It is worth noting that the presence of confounding infections, can mask the importance of the primary aetiology. Taylor et al. report the incidence of HBoV following its identification in 2005 from the respiratory tract samples of children, as an important respiratory pathogen in children. However, the role of this virus on its own as a pathogen of significance was initially unclear, co-infection with other viruses or bacteria was common and confounding.Moesker et al. studied whether HBoV alone could cause acute respiratory infections in children.',\n",
       "  'Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), they were able to exclude co-infections amongst those admitted to intensive care unit and studied HBoV viral loads. Of the 990 children who tested positive for a respiratory virus by RT-PCR, HBoV and RSV were detected in 178 and 366 of the children respectively. Forty-nine HBoV-positive patients and 72 RSV-positive patients were admitted to the intensive care. Seven HBoV-infected cases with severe ARI had no other co-infection (7/49, 14%). Importantly, these children did not have another detectable virus as determined by highly sensitive NGS. Also, they had much higher HBoV loads than other patients positive for HBoV, i.e., those with a co-infection. Although small, this study provides strong support that HBoV can cause serious ARI in children with no viral and bacterial co-infections.The history of the human viral challenge model Since Sir Edward Jenner performed the first documented HVC study with smallpox on the 14 th of May 1796 the usefulness of such studies has been apparent  .',\n",
       "  'More than a century later, Sir Christopher Andrews returned from the US in 1931 he had observed the use of chimpanzees in the study of influenza. The funding for similar work in the UK was insufficient, and therefore Sir Christopher enrolled students from St Bartholomew\\'s Hospital in London. He explained the next best thing would be a \"Bart\\'s\" student as \"they were cheaper than chimpanzees\". Over 100 students immediately enrolled, but continued their studies and were not isolated in the same way the chimpanzees had been in the USA  . Unfortunately the investigators believed that the symptoms observed may not have been due to the challenge virus, but other respiratory infections acquired in the community, thus confounding the studies. A year later the UK\\'s Medical Research Council (MRC) terminated the work.After the conclusion of World War II, the withdrawal of the US troops from the UK left the American Red Cross \\'Harvard Hospital\\' Field Unit on Salisbury plain.',\n",
       "  'The hospital became the Common Cold Unit (CCU) led by Dr David Tyrell, from 1946, volunteers were inoculated by instilling small quantities of the virus into their noses  . The CCU housed healthy volunteers in relative isolation from other people, thereby reducing the risk of contact with community-acquired sources of infection or from them passing on the virus to members of the public. The unit was eventually closed in 1989; during four decades of research, it attracted 20,000 volunteers. Its research contributed to a better understanding of respiratory viruses, viral lifecycle, possible vaccines  as well as the first licensed antiinfluenza compound amantadine  .The use of healthy volunteers in the HVC model provided, and still offers, a unique opportunity to describe the viral lifecycle. Investigators know with certainty the time of infection, nasal virus shedding can be measured, symptoms recorded prospectively, and participants are selected with low pre-existing immunity to the challenge virus to ensure a statistically significant infection rate with a small number of volunteers.',\n",
       "  'Thus, such studies can maximise the safety and efficacy data obtained while minimising the risk to study volunteers and limited research funding.Although serum IgG, for influenza virus, was traditionally measured via the HAI assay, as the entry criteria for volunteers into studies, micro neutralisation assays are used for RSV and HRV. Other work does suggest screening for antibodies to the NA influenza surface protein should be considered  or T-cell responses to internal proteins  should be considered.After the closure of the CCU experimental infection studies continued in the USA using small motels and hotels replacing the huts on Salisbury Plain. These studies contributed to the significant development of the new NA inhibitors during the 1990s, including the inhaled drug zanamivir and the orally available drug oseltamivir           .Studies however also continued in the UK, specifically the University of Southampton who performed important work in atopic volunteers, demonstrating they had more severe colds when experimentally challenged with rhinovirus, than non-atopic controls  .The experimental A/Texas H1N1 influenza virus that was used successfully during the 1990s was implicated in the development of myocarditis in an experimentally infected subject, although a causal link was never demonstrated  .',\n",
       "  \"However, this incident halted work in the USA for a substantial period.Most, if not all, challenge viruses are manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standard. Although controlled nasal inoculation differs from naturally occurring infectionin which exposure to variable quantities of the virus may occur at various mucosal sites -the developed HVC model used in challenge studies mimics natural disease as far as possible [25, 117, 118] .We have described the production of a new GMP stock of virus using an HRV-16 isolate from an 18-year-old experimentally infected healthy female volunteer, provided by colleagues from University of Virginia Children's Hospital, USA. Importantly, the clinical sample was provided with the appropriate medical history and consent of the donor. We manufactured this new HRV-16 stock by minimal passage in a WI-38 cell line, to reduce the risk of mutations during the Good Manufacturing Practice process.\",\n",

However, it is not easy to diagnose between the different aetiologies of ARIs, and better diagnostics are needed  .Symptoms are common to each infection and manifest on a gradient.',\n",
       "  'Generally, but far from always, influenza infection is more likely to result in a patient feeling so unwell as to take to their bed and have a fever, than RSV, an HRV, CoV or other common cold virus infection, during which daily life is usually less impacted.A variety of animal models exist to research respiratory viruses such as influenza    , RSV            , HRV [22,    . No single animal offers a platform for all respiratory viruses that infect humans, and different animal models exist for the same virus, which can give different, often conflicting results.In addition, the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) were developed over 50 years ago to provide guidance and ensure humane animal research. Over time they have become national and international legislation/regulations.',\n",
       "  'The policies of organisations that fund or conduct animal research include these principles as part of the condition of funding  .The shared symptomatology of respiratory viruses requires a single standard research platform that can be used to evaluate respiratory disease pathogenesis and the efficacy of candidate therapeutics. The use of a dedicated, purpose-built 24 en-suite bedroom isolation facility in which carefully screened volunteers can be safely inoculated with challenge viruses and intensively monitored may help reduce the use of animals while providing a single consistent research platform with standardised evaluable endpoints for respiratory virus research. Also, we have used a standardised diary card across our studies, which allows for comparison of the symptoms that each virus causes and the efficacy of the therapeutic being tested. We have included a copy of the diary card in the Additional file 1.It is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of a specific antiviral therapeutic \"in the field\" due to the presence of circulating community co-infections of differing microbial aetiology.',\n",
       "  'The HVC model allows the opportunity to study a virus in isolation. HVC studies and field studies are complementary research stratagems necessary for the development of effective ARI therapeutics.In contemporary HVC trials, (Fig. 1 ) healthy volunteers are administered an investigational therapeutic either before (prophylaxis trials) or after (treatment trials) inoculation with the specific challenge strain of the virus. The viruses used in the HVC model are not attenuated and produce symptoms consistent with clinically observed ARI [25, 117, 118] . Each virus is propagated under GMP conditions, with a minimal number of passages from the isolates to the challenge stocks [118, 142] . The few mutations that occur within the virus are rapidly selected out due to a genetic bottleneck, with the consequence that the virus in the human host is considered wild-type  .',\n",
       "  \"The similarity between virus recovered from the inoculated host and the originator reference virus strain provides assurance that the model disease process is closely aligned with the reference virus strain and is not altered nor attenuated.There are limited licensed therapeutic options against respiratory viruses, highlighting a significant unmet medical need. A model such as the HVC allows the rapid evaluation of novel therapeutics. The model shortens both preclinical and early clinical development phases by providing a better understanding of the host and pathogen's initial interaction and has the potential to make the necessary vaccines and medicines more rapidly available than traditional development approaches otherwise might.Shortening the traditional development pathway through the early use of a Proof of Concept (PoC) study that incorporates the HVC model (Fig. 2) provides essential evaluable endpoints.\",\n",
       "  'Unlike conventional phase 1 studies which rarely include any assessment of efficacy, almost all HVC studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints such as reduction in AUC viral load (mainly recovered from upper respiratory tract samples such as nasal wash or nasopharyngeal swab), volunteer self-reported symptoms, peak symptom score, total symptom score amongst others. Small numbers of subjectsoften in the order of 30-45 per treatment group-are typically included in these rapid to execute short duration studies. The resulting safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data in controlled conditions, guide decisions on whether or not to progress to field studies, providing a most valuable set of data immediately after, or even as part of, the conventional phase 1 safety study.The HVC model also opens a different development route alongside traditional phase 1 allowing rapid progress to statistically powered phase 2b studies that will generate the efficacy data needed to support licensing, while still providing suitable safety data.',\n",
       "  'The FDA guidance on developing influenza therapeutics  states that challenge trials cannot take the place of efficacy (phase 2) trials. The guidance states; \"…Challenge trials can provide useful exposure-response and safety information, as well as an opportunity to demonstrate pharmacological antiviral activity in humans under controlled conditions outside the influenza season. Specifically, data from challenge trials can contribute to dose selection for phase 2b and phase 3 trials, and provide the opportunity to explore the effects of different times of drug initiation relative to virus exposure...\".Challenge trial refinements are closing the gap between the experimental infection model and the natural infection setting. The HVC study duration of several weeks is shorter than a field-based phase 2 study that waits for a natural outbreak of the virus and the duration of which can be several months/years. These studies save Fig. 1 The Human Viral Challenge Model.',\n",
       "  'The study typically consists of inputs, such as the volunteers, their selection criteria, isolation in quarantine and exposure to a GMP virus. There are two treatment options; a vaccination/prophylaxis with an antiviral or b treatment with an antiviral. Outputs from the study, summarised on the right, such as virus symptoms, virus shedding etc. X is the number of days before virus exposure vaccination may occur. Y is the number of days post virus exposure that a volunteer may be followed for development time when the transition between phases is fully optimised.Importantly, unlike traditional phase 1b/phase 2 studies, HVC studies are not dependent on a natural outbreak of infection, which can occur at random, and for which the exact time of infection may not be apparent. They provide evaluable endpoints, comparative PD and PK data, along with additional biomarker data on product performance in humans.',\n",
       "  'It must, however, be stated that most often such studies enrol otherwise healthy young adults which imply that the outcome of the infection in the placebo group may be seen as mild to moderate, to some extent. The safety of volunteers has to remain the priority of investigators.The HRV/HVC model can be a potent tool, not just to study HRV infection and disease, but also to investigate the mechanisms of exacerbation in patients with chronic respiratory disease and to conduct efficacy studies for new therapies.Human challenge studies with HRV have been shown to produce infection in over 90% of serologically susceptible subjects and result in a clinical syndrome that is comparable to that reported with natural colds [145, 146] . Symptoms usually appear within 24 hours and peak at 48-72 hours after inoculation. Virus shedding follows a pattern similar to that of their symptoms.',\n",
       "  'In recent times, several hundred inoculations of adult subjects have been reported and have established this as a safe and effective method in which to study HRV-related disease in both healthy and asthmatic subjects  .These studies have provided a knowledge base to further develop the HRV experimental model and provide a controlled and useful tool to develop new therapies for the disease areas associated with HRV infection. New treatments for asthma and COPD are urgently needed, and small animal models of asthma are poorly predictive of efficacy. Most drugs that are effective in these animal models are not found to be effective in later stages of development in humans.',\n",
       "  'Models that more closely follow clinical features of human asthma and COPD are needed [32,      ].We have already described current influenza antiviral drugs that can shorten disease and reduce the severity of symptoms if taken early enough after infection, and their prophylactic use can decrease the risk of infection; their utility has been debated however  .The two main classes of currently effective antiinfluenza drugs are the NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir (Relenza™), oseltamivir (Tamiflu™), peramivir (Rapivab™)  and M2 inhibitors, although drug resistance makes this class unusable  .The HVC model has recently been used extensively to evaluate new classes of antiviral compounds against influenza, including those such as experimental monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes within the highly conserved and exposed part of the M2 viral surface Fig. 2 The role of the HVC model in the clinical development pathway. Short duration proof of concept studies, which incorporate the HVC model, typically include small numbers of subjects.',\n",

Specifically, and given the described historical experience with RSV vaccines, it is important that benefit can first be demonstrated in a healthy population.In the past, unlike influenza and HRV, the HVC model has not been routinely used with RSV.',\n",
       "  'Recently, however, there are several antiviral therapeutics that have reached an advanced stage of development using the model.We had for some time wished to restart the HVC/RSV studies at the University of London, the two significant challenges that had stalled antiviral development for RSV presented a considerable research need. In association with the DeVincenzo lab at the University of Tenessee and the biotech company Alnylam, we set about designing possibly the first HVC/RSV study.Alnylam pioneered the use of RNA interference (RNAi) which is a natural mechanism that regulates protein expression and is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Working with both groups, we manufactured an RSV Type A virus to GMP standard and titrated it in 35 human volunteers who we divided into five groups, each which was intranasally inoculated with increasing titre (3.0-5.4 log plaque-forming units/person) of the challenge virus. Intranasally. Overall, in this new model, 77% of volunteers consistently shed virus.',\n",
       "  'Infection rate, viral loads, disease severity, and safety were similar between cohorts and were unrelated to the quantity of RSV received.Symptoms began soon after initial viral detection, peaked in severity near when viral load peaked and subsided as viral loads slowly declined. We concluded that regardless of the titre administered once infections were established the viral load drove illness. We saw no adverse events linked to the virus  . Using this new model we conducted an HVC clinical study and demonstrated for the first time that an RNAi had significant antiviral activity against human RSV infection -this established the first-ever proof of concept for an RNAi therapeutic in humans adults  .An editorial in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, described the utility of the HVC/RSV model saying; \"This model permits the relatively quick and efficient study of new therapeutics in humans and assists in making critical decisions whether to advance a product into costly human trials in populations at highest risk for disease; children, elderly or immunocompromised patients.',\n",
       "  'This constitutes a major and welcome advance in the field of RSV.\" It is notable that two compounds that have distinct modes of action have recently been evaluated using the HVC model.First-in-class nucleoside analogue ALS-008176, the efficacy of which was first demonstrated in the HVC model, is currently under evaluation in hospitalised infants [160, 161] . The HVC trial was of randomised, double-blind design, and studied healthy adults inoculated with RSV Memphis 37B  . A total of 62 participants received ALS-008176 or placebo for five days after confirmation of RSV infection by PCR (tested twice daily post inoculation). The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) for viral load post infection. More rapid RSV clearance and a greater reduction in viral load, with accompanying improvements in the severity of clinical disease, were demonstrated in the groups treated with ALS-008176 when compared to the placebo group  .',\n",
       "  'Intensive sampling allowed for any potential mutations associated with resistance to be rapidly identified. No such resistant mutations were observed  .An RSV-entry inhibitor, GS-5806, a second molecule, first-in-[its]-class was also evaluated. Among the 54 subjects that received active treatment, lower viral load, lower total mucus weight and a lower AUC symptom score were highly significant when compared to placebo  . Based on these challenge study data, this therapeutic is now also progressing into potentially pivotal field studies  .An essential element of design in both studies was the timing of the first administration of therapeutic postexperimental virus inoculation; the timing was dependent on the detection of virus in nasal wash samples post inoculation of challenge virus by a rapid PCR assay  , rather than at an arbitrary time point. Subsequently the therapeutic was administered every 12 hours. Careful dose timing, at a clinically relevant point of detection, contributed to the positive outcomes of both studies.',\n",
       "  'It is also believed that by using this \"triggered dosing\" model, it better mimicked what would happen in a clinical setting as symptoms are known to appear soon after the onset of virus shedding.The HVC model is not limited to novel antiviral compounds but is also important for the evaluation of novel vaccines. Influenza vaccine performance in recent years raises questions about the most appropriate correlates of protection.Unlike field studies, HVC studies are useful tools for assessing the correlates of protection, vital for vaccine development [103, 104, 164] . Specifically, the importance of the humoral and cellular responses has been highlighted along with the pre-existing T-cell immunity for other respiratory viruses  .A recent publication describes the use of the HVC model to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel intranasal proteosome-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (P-TIV). In two separate studies, selected subjects who were naïve to A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus, were dosed via nasal spray with one of three regimens of P-TIV or placebo.',\n",
       "  'Together, the studies evaluated one or two doses, 15 μg or 30 μg, either once only or twice 14 days apart (1 x 30 μg, 2 x 30 μg, 2 x 15 μg) and subjects were challenged with A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus. Immune responses to the vaccine antigens were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and nasal wash secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies. Vaccine efficacy was observed ranging from 58% to 82%, comparable to traditional vaccines. The studies also demonstrate that protection against illness associated with evidence of influenza infection significantly correlated with pre-challenge HAI (serum IgG) titres (p = 0.0003) and mucosal IgA (p≤0.0001) individually, and HAI (p = 0.028) and sIgA (p = 0.0014) together. HAI and sIgA levels were inversely related to rates of illness. These studies demonstrated the efficacy of this novel intranasal vaccine and answered some important questions concerning true correlates of protection against influenza infection which will help drive future vaccine design.',\n",
       "  'As well as achieving its primary aims, it revealed valuable insights into the correlates of protection and will, we hope, aid future vaccine design  .An inter-seasonal or universal influenza vaccine is desperately needed; it will save many lives, whether in those unexpected years when the recommended composition is not matched, or when a pandemic occurs, as it did in 2009. The significance of the 1918 pandemic [165, 166] makes it very clear; up to 100 million people died. A universal vaccine is one that can be prepared for the unexpected, a virus that occurs due to the reassortment of viral genes from different host species.The HVC model is possibly the only way to initially test such a universal vaccine.A universal candidate could generate an immune response against the highly conserved virus ion channel protein M2,     , although no vaccine has been shown to be effective in this regard; monoclonal antibodies alone have, the HVC model showed their efficacy  .',\n",
       "  'Alternatively, a vaccine may target the conserved stalk of the HA protein [104, 171] , or elicit a T-cell response to the internal proteins     . All are possibilities that have been and can be explored more efficiently using the HVC model.Although HVC studies provide PoC, researchers, as we have shown, have employed regulatory design standards typical of later phase efficacy studies.With the development of molecular technology, it is now possible to refine the statistical analysis by stratifying the subjects based on their immune profile. For instance, it is now possible to assess whether a subject is carrying other known respiratory pathogens (bacteria, viruses etc.) and if there is a possible impact on the set of results from the volunteer. Subjects often consent for further analysis of their samples, which allows a valuable biobank of samples to be built for further testing.',\n",
       "  'Moving forward, such samples will allow the use of the HVC model to understand further what happens when a virus infects a person.It is worth noting that the HVC model is not limited to PoC work on potential therapeutic agents; it is also extensively being used for research purposes, upon which improved treatments for respiratory viruses can be built. In recent years it has been used to demonstrate \"gene switching signatures\" that could form part of a diagnostic that would reveal infected individuals before they become symptomatic, in the early stages of infection; this could be vitally important in the event of a pandemic [176, 177] .Also, the HVC model has been used to allow a comparison of the relative disease dynamics of different respiratory viruses  and to provide a better understanding of the interaction of the virus and the human host [26, 178, 179] .The HVC model has increased our understanding of the viral life cycle and disease pathogenesis in a tightly controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers.',\n",
       "  'Each volunteer is isolated from each other, and the wider community, ensuring that the disease under consideration is the only one of interest.The applicability of the virus used to challenge volunteers in the HVC model to a virus that an individual might become exposed to in the \"real world\" is significant. Whether challenge trials are feasible is dependent on the availability of adequately safety-tested challenge virus strains that are of know providence.The HVC model provides certain knowledge of the character of the virus; the exact time point of infection; measurability of nasal virus shedding; prospective recording of symptoms and pre-selection of participants for viral challenge who are sero-suitable.',\n",
       "  'This ensures that a statistically significant rate of infection is achieved with the minimal number of volunteers, thus optimising the risk-benefit ratio that supports the determination of therapeutic efficacy.Crucial to HVC study design is the timing of administration of the first dose of product under investigation to determine optimal effectiveness, not just in the challenge study itself, but in both later stage clinical studies and final clinical use.The HVC model is an important tool in drug development, in particular with regard to acute respiratory infections. It can accelerate the development of therapeutics that address multiple unmet medical needs. It helps in the understanding of the relationship between a virus and its human host and offers the potential for the development of early-stage diagnostics. It contributes towards identifying new areas for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       "  'Possibly, and arguably, more importantly, it can ensure that scarce medical resources are directed towards later stage clinical development in an evidence-based manner, and promising therapeutic opportunities are prioritised.A careful and targeted study design process is a crucial step towards the successful outcome of a challenge trial, because almost all parameters, can be either controlled or at least known (either pre-or post-hoc). Furthermore, results from such trials can be used to make commercial decisions and can lead to major publications, expanding the collective understanding of the scientific community.Samples from such experiments are of immense value to researchers for the understanding of host interaction mechanisms and the development and validation of therapeutics.',\n",

Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset  , consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time  . This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset  . To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS.Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols  , and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role.',\n",
       "  'Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract [11, 12] , and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets  . The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken place on the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with at least 130 passengers tested positive for 2019-nCoV as at 10 February 2020  . Identifying which modes are important for 2019-nCoV transmission would inform the importance of personal protective measures such as face masks (and specifically which types) and hand hygiene.The first human infections were identified through a surveillance system for pneumonia of unknown aetiology, and all of the earliest infections therefore had Modelling studies incorporating healthcare capacity and processes pneumonia.',\n",
       "  'It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions [15, 16] , but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections. Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is perhaps the most urgent research priority, because it determines the strength of public health response required. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, and therefore at the upper end of severity scales in influenza pandemic plans, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, especially during milder seasons, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly.Beyond a robust assessment of overall severity, it is also important to determine high risk groups.',\n",
       "  'Infections would likely be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, but there have not yet been reports of severity of infections in pregnant women, and very few cases have been reported in children  .Those under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity.',\n",
       "  'Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum.Another question on susceptibility is regarding whether 2019-nCoV infection confers neutralising immunity, usually but not always, indicated by the presence of neutralising antibodies in convalescent sera. Some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies  . A separate question pertains to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or of disease [18, 19] .',\n",
       "  'If either of these were to be relevant, the transmission dynamics could become more complex.A wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. Internationally, the past week has seen an increasing number of countries issue travel advisories or outright entry bans on persons from Hubei province or China as a whole, as well as substantial cuts in flights to and from affected areas out of commercial considerations. Evaluation of these mobility restrictions can confirm their potential effectiveness in delaying local epidemics  , and can also inform when as well as how to lift these restrictions.If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons  .',\n",
       "  'A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic  .Similarly to international travel interventions, local social distancing measures should be assessed for their impact and when they could be safely discontinued, albeit in a coordinated and deliberate manner across China such that recrudescence in the epidemic curve is minimised.',\n",
       "  'Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in China could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time.At the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community.The Table summarises research gaps to guide the public health response identified.In conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections.',\n",
       "  'Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae.

Beyond the first year, one interesting possibility in the longer term, perhaps borne of wishful hope, is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity. Particularly if children are being infected and are developing immunity hereafter, 2019-nCoV could optimistically become the fifth human coronavirus causing the common cold.None declared.'],\n",
       " ['Hantaan virus (HTNV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Previous studies have identified interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) as an interferon-stimulated gene family. However, the role of IFITMs in HTNV infection is unclear. In this study, we observed that IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs12252 C allele and CC genotype associated with the disease severity and HTNV load in the plasma of HFRS patients. In vitro experiments showed that the truncated protein produced by the rs12252 C allele exhibited an impaired anti-HTNV activity. We also proved that IFITM3 was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by overexpression and RNAi assays, likely via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry demonstrated by binding and entry assay. Localization of IFITM3 in late endosomes was also observed. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription of IFITM3 is negatively regulated by an lncRNA negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR).',\n",
       "  'Taken together, we conclude that IFITM3, negatively regulated by NRIR, inhibits HTNV infection, and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the plasma HTNV load and the disease severity of patients with HFRS.Text: associates with the severity of disease, indicating the importance of viremia in the pathogenesis of HFRS (2) . Therefore, further studies of host factors limiting HTNV infection and influencing antiviral response as well as disease progression are clinically significant and timely. The human family of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was discovered 25 years ago to consist of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (3) . This family includes five members, namely, IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, among which IFITM1, 2, and 3 possess antiviral activity (4) . Different IFITM proteins have different antiviral spectrum (5) . For example, IFITM3 has been shown to prevent influenza virus infection in vitro and in mice (6, 7) , and it also inhibits multiple viruses, including filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, flaviviruses, and even Ebola and Zika virus (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .',\n",
       "  'The antiviral mechanism of IFITM3 is thought to be the restriction of viral entry into cells (4, 12) . Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide variations in a genetic sequence that occur at an appreciable frequency in the population. Several SNPs has been identified in IFITM3, among which the rs12252 site with C allele results in a N-terminal truncation of IFITM3 protein, leading to impaired inhibition of influenza virus in vitro (13, 14) . Notably, the frequencies of rs12252 C allele and CC genotype correlate with disease severity in patients infected with influenza virus (13, 15) . HTNV has been shown to induce a type I interferon response (though in later time postinfection) (16, 17) . While overexpression of IFITM1, 2, and 3 in Vero E6 cells has been reported to inhibit HTNV infection (18) , however, the effect of IFITMs on HTNV infection in human cell lines and its role in HFRS still remain unknown.LncRNA comprises a group of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nt that function as gene regulators.',\n",
       "  'Some lncRNAs have been shown to play a role in innate immunity (19) . Among them, negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR) (lncRNA NRIR, also known as lncRNA-CMPK2) is a non-coding ISG that negatively regulates IFITM1 and Mx1 expression in HCV infection (20) . Notably, IFITM3 is largely homologous to IFITM1, but the role of NRIR in the regulation of IFITM3 in HTNV infection remains unclear.In the present study, we investigate the effect of IFTTM3 on the replication of HTNV and its role in the development of HFRS in humans. We provide primary evidence suggesting that IFITM3, regulated by NRIR, can inhibit HTNV infection and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the disease severity and viral load in patients with HFRS. This study expands our understanding of the antiviral activity of IFITM3 and enriches our knowledge of innate immune responses to HTNV infection.This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the biomedical research guidelines involving human participants established by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China.',\n",

The HTNV S segment and NP levels were suppressed by IFITM3 overexpression in HUVEC cells (Figures 5B-D) . They were also suppressed by expressing IFITM1 and IFITM3 in A549 cells (Figures 5B-D) .The inhibitory effect of IFITM3 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of HTNV NP ( Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). These results were in accordance with the above-described RNAi results. To determine whether IFITM3 inhibited HTNV binding or entry, HUVEC and A549 cells were incubated with HTNV (moi = 1) at 4°C for 1 h, unbound virus was washed away, and HTNV RNA collected at this time point represents HTNV bound to the cell surface.',\n",
       "  'After virus binding, the cells were shifted to 37°C for 2 h to allow HTNV internalization, and HTNV RNA collected at this time point represents cell-internalized virus. As a positive control for inhibition of virus entry, we incubated a parallel group of cells with HTNV at pH = 5.5 as described in Section \"Materials and Methods.\" Expression of IFITM3 did not affect HTNV binding ( Figure 6A ) but significantly suppressed HTNV entry in both HUVEC and A549 cells (Figure 6B ). iFiTM3 Was Partially localized to laMP1 + late endosomes in the host cellsTo elucidate the mechanism of IFITM3 function, we investigated the subcellular localization of IFTIM3 in the host cells. IFITM3 was found partially localized to LAMP1 + late endosomes in HUVECs analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure 6C) . The co-localization of IFITM3 and LAMP1 + late endosomes had also been found in A549 cells (27) .',\n",
       "  'Because the transfer into LAMP1 + late endosomes is a necessary step for HTNV entry (28) , this result provides an evidence for the anti-HTNV mechanism of IFITM3.LncRNA-and microRNA-mediated regulation of IFITM3 has been reported in several studies. We tested the change of previously reported regulators of IFITMs, such as NRAV, NRIR, and miR-130a after HTNV infection, among which NRIR was the only changed one (downregulated) after HTNV infection ( Figure 7A ; Figure S4 in Supplementary Material) in HUVEC. However, the expression of NRIR was unchanged in A549 cells. We overexpressed NRIR in HUVEC and A549 cells using the pcDNA3.1 vector ( Figure 7B) . Importantly, overexpression of NRIR significantly suppressed IFITM3 mRNA and pre-mRNA levels and facilitated HTNV infection in HUVEC and A549 cells (Figures 7C-E) . These data suggest that lncRNA NRIR is a negative regulator of IFITM3 transcription.Hantaan virus is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus from the genus Hantavirus within the family Bunyaviridae.',\n",
       "  'It causes HFRS, which is an important threat to public health worldwide. It is also a potential weapon for biological terrorism. Reservoir animals, usually rodents, are asymptomatic during persistent infection. Unlike in rodents, Hantavirus infection leads to HFRS and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans (21) . The major clinical characteristics of HFRS include fever, hemorrhage, hypotension, and renal injury (1, 21) , causing severe manifestations and death in some cases. The current standard of care for HFRS relies on symptomatic and supportive treatment. It has been confirmed that the plasma viral load is associated with the severity of HFRS, implicating the importance of viremia in the pathogenesis of HFRS (2). However, no direct antiviral medications are currently available for this illness. Interferon is the key molecule for the antiviral response and has been used as an antiviral medicine in many diseases.',\n",
       "  'It has been reported that HTNV infection induces a late type I interferon response (16) . However, the set of ISGs required for IFN-mediated inhibition of HTNV has not yet been identified. Therefore, identification of ISGs that are effective against HTNV is an attractive strategy to identify novel therapeutic targets.In this study, we demonstrated a significantly high frequency of the rs12252 C allele and CC genotype among HFRS patients with severe illness compared with mildly infected individuals and the healthy Han Chinese. The rs12252 C allele and CC genotype are also found to be associated with higher plasma viral load in the early stage of HFRS. We also discovered that HTNV infection induces IFITMs, and the truncated IFITM3 produced by rs12252 C allele exhibits significantly decreased anti-HTNV activity. Interestingly, IFITM3 is found to restrict HTNV infection with a mechanism of cellular entry inhibition.',\n",
       "  'Indeed, IFITM3 is localized to the late endosome in the host cells, which is a necessary structure for HTNV entry. In addition, we find that HTNV infection downregulated lncRNA NRIR 48 h post infection, which negatively regulates the transcription of IFITM3. Collectively, these results suggest that IFITM3, regulated by NRIR, inhibits HTNV infection, and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the disease severity and viral load in patients with HFRS.The antiviral properties of IFITM proteins were identified in 2009 in an RNAi screen for host factors that influence influenza virus replication (29) . IFITM1, 2, and 3 have been demonstrated to possess antiviral activity in several studies. Everitt et al. demonstrated that the severity of influenza virus infection was greatly increased in IFITM3-knockout mice compared with wild-type animals (15) . Different IFITM members have also been confirmed to inhibit the cellular entry of multiple virus families (including filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and flaviviruses) (7, (9) (10) (11) 30) .',\n",
       "  'For example, HIV-1 and HCV infection are inhibited by IFITM1 (31) (32) (33) (34) . It is commonly believed that IFITMs restrict viral infection at the stage of cellular entry (12) . Recent studies suggested that the cellular location of different IFITMs may influence the range of viruses restricted by each protein (5) . IFITM1 prevents HCV entry because it colocalizes with CD81 on the cell membrane, interrupting the endocytosis of HCV particles (32) , whereas IFITM3 confines influenza virus in acidified endosomal compartments (27) . Notably, retrovirus subvirus particles (ISVPs), which do not require endosomal acidification for entry, are not inhibited by IFITM3 expression, suggesting that IFITM3 may function at the stage of endosomal entry (35) . Studies utilizing cell-cell fusion assays have suggested that IFITM3 blocks the entry of enveloped virus by preventing the fusion of the viral membrane with a limiting membrane of the host cell, either the plasma membrane and/or the endosomal membranes.',\n",
       "  'The results obtained using two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) suggest that IFITM proteins may reduce membrane fluidity and increase the spontaneous positive curvature in the outer leaflet of membranes (36) . In the present study, we demonstrated that IFN-α2a (20 U/ ml) significantly inhibited HTNV infection, siRNA-mediated depletion of IFITM3 alone significantly mitigated the antiviral effect of IFN-α2a in both HUVEC and A549 cells, whereas depletion of IFITM1 alone alleviated the antiviral effect of IFN-α2a in A549 cells. Overexpression of IFITM3 inhibited HTNV infection to HUVEC and A549 cells. IFITM1 overexpression was also effective in inhibition of HTNV in A549 cells. All these results suggest that IFITM3 is an important control factor under natural infection of HTNV. Our results also demonstrate that the effectiveness of IFITM3 is cell type-independent, which is in accordance with the results from similar viruses, such as RVFV (18) .',\n",
       "  'Binding and entry assays, conducted by controlling the temperature and pH, showed that IFITM3 did not significantly influence HTNV binding but inhibited HTNV entry into HUVEC and A549 cells. Indeed, IFITM3 partially localizes to the late endosome of the host cells, which is a necessary site for the HTNV entry. However, we failed in tracking the transportation of HTNV in infected cells possibly due to the lack of fluorescence-labeled virus. In addition, IFITM1 also suppressed HTNV infection in A549 cells. The mechanism underlying anti-HTNV effect of IFITM1 remains undetermined and deserves to be further explored.According to a recent study on the three-dimensional structure of IFITM3, there is a C-terminal transmembrane α-helix and a two-N-terminal intramembrane α-helices (shown in Figure 2A as black boxes) in IFITM3 (14) . There are two splice variants that differ by the presence or absence of the first N-terminal 21 amino acids (deleted part, shown in Figure 2A as red dotted line).',\n",
       "  'Several SNPs including 13 non-synonymous, 13 synonymous, 1 in-frame stop, and 1 splice site acceptoraltering have been reported in the translated IFITM3 sequence (15, 29) . Among them, the rare SNP rs12252C allele of IFITM3 truncates the protein as described above, leading to a reduced inhibition of influenza virus infection in A549 cells (15) . We demonstrated that truncated IFITM3 protein also loses the ability to inhibit HTNV infection in vitro. In Northern European patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza or pandemic influenza A virus, increased homozygosity of the minor C allele of SNP rs12252 in IFITM3 was observed (37) . In Chinese patients infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus, there was also an increased frequency of the C allele and CC genotype of SNP rs12252 (13) . In the present study, we observed an increased frequency of the C allele and CC genotype of SNP rs12252 in severely infected HFRS patients compared with healthy control and mildly affected patients.',\n",
       "  'Patients carrying the CC genotype also had higher plasma viral loads compared with those with the CT/TT genotype. Given the impaired function of the IFITM3 protein produced by the C mutation, and the fact that enrichment of the rs12252 C allele in patients with severe disease and the higher viral load in patients with the CC genotype, this founding suggests that IFITM3 plays a pivotal role in the anti-HTNV response in vivo. We speculate that the much higher level of CC allele at healthy population of Han Chinese compared with Caucasians may place the Chinese at a higher risk for developing severe illness upon HTNV infection, which needs further investigation.LncRNAs are a group of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nt that function as gene regulators, playing a role in regulating multiple cellular functions, including the innate immunity. For example, lncRNA NEAT1 is reported to be upregulated by influenza virus or PolyI:C stimulation, which promotes IL-8 expression (38) .',\n",
       "  'lncRNA NRAV has been shown to negatively regulate the initial transcription of IFITM3 and Mx1 by affecting the histone modification of these genes (25) . lncRNA NRIR is a non-coding ISG, which has been reported to negatively regulate IFITM1 and Mx1 expression in HCV infection (20) . Mir-130a was also reported as a regulator of IFITM1 (23) . In this analysis, lncRNA NRIR was downregulated in HUVECs after HTNV infection for 48 h, overexpression of NRIR negatively regulates the initial transcription of IFITM3, evidenced by the decreased pre-mRNA as well as mRNA levels. NRIR overexpression also facilitated HTNV infection. These results indicate that the downregulation of NRIR after HTNV infection is possibly involved in the activation of innate immune responses against HTNV infection. We have also evaluated other potential regulators of IFITM3 before we choose NRIR for further study. Another lncRNA that can regulate IFITM3, i.e., NRAV (NR_038854), remained unchanged after HTNV infection ( Figures S4A,B in Supplementary Material).',\n",
       "  'Additionally, miR-130a, which potentially regulate IFITM3, was also unaltered after HTNV infection ( Figures S4C,D in Supplementary Material).In conclusion, this study revealed a critical role for IFITM3 in HTNV infection. We demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that IFITM3 is a newly identified anti-HTNV ISG; its expression is negatively regulated by NRIR; and its antiviral activity seems via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry into the host cells. In addition, we discovered that the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 C allele and CC genotype correlates with the plasma HTNV load and the severity of HFRS; and the rs12252 C allele produces a truncated IFITM3 protein (NΔ21) that attenuates its anti-HTNV function. These results provide new insights into the role of IFITM3 in regulating innate immunity against HTNV infection, which is the basis for identifying new targets to develop novel agent against this worldwide infectious disease.'],\n",

On June 11 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level, phase 6  , meaning that the A/H1N1 flu had spread in more than two continents and reached pandemic proportions. As of June 13, 2010, it had caused over 18,172 deaths in more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities  .\",\n",
       "  'Most illness, especially the severe illness and deaths, had occurred among healthy young adults, which was markedly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza [4, 5] .China is highly susceptible to A/H1N1 because of its huge population and high residential density, besides the high infectiousness of this novel influenza virus. After the first imported case reported on May 11, 2009 , the confirmed cases were reported in various provinces of China  . By the late of October 2009, A/H1N1 cases had increased dramatically, with 44,981 cases and 6 deaths confirmed at the end of October 2009. The A/ H1N1 infection rate peaked in November 2009, when approximately 1500 new cases of A/H1N1 were being confirmed each day. By the end of this month, a total of 92,904 cases and 200 deaths had resulted from A/ H1N1-related causes  .',\n",

However, there were few public reports on the assessment of the effect of these policies and the level of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associating with A/H1N1 among general population.It is well-known that confused comprehension and negative attitude towards the emerging communicable disease may lead to unnecessary worry and chaos, even excessive panic which would aggravate the disease epidemic  . For instance, during SARS epidemic from 2002 to 2004, the misconceptions and the excessive panic of Chinese public to SARS led the public resistant to comply with the suggested preventive measures such as avoiding public transportation, going to hospital when they were sick, which contributed to the rapid spread of SARS and resulted in a more serious epidemic situation, making China one of the worst affected countries with over 5327 cases and 439 deaths [10, 11] .',\n",

SARS experience has demonstrated the importance of monitoring the public perception in disease epidemic control, which may affect the compliance of community to the precautionary strategies. Understanding related factors affecting people to undertake precautionary behavior may also help decision-makers take appropriate measures to promote individual or community health. Therefore, it is important to monitor and analyze the public response to the emerging disease.To investigate community responses to A/H1N1 in China, we conducted this telephone survey to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of A/H1N1 among general population in China and put forward policy recommendations to government in case of future similar conditions.This study was performed in seven urban regions (Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jingzhou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shenzhen cities) and two rural areas (Jingzhou and Zhengzhou counties) of China with over one million people in each region.\",\n",

It is important to encourage the public to adopt precautionary behaviors, which is based on the correct knowledge of the epidemic and appropriate response among residents. Many studies have examined the various levels of KAP about infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS, avian influenza    . Some studies have been reported specifically on community responses to A/H1N1 in Australia and Europe [16, 17] .\",\n",

Multivariate analysis results showed that workers and farmers with lower education level were less likely to have this knowledge, which indicated that the contents and forms of propaganda should be more understandable and acceptable. A large proportion of residents in our survey overlooked the indirect hand contact and hand-shaking transmission route and about one third of public misconceived that A/H1N1 was food borne, which was associated with the previous knowledge of avian flu and the new A/H1N1 flu in the general population. The confusion with avian flu might mislead some residents to believe that the A/H1N1 virus is fatal and cause public panic  . Therefore, it is important for the government and health authorities to provide continuously updated information of the emerging disease through televisions, newspapers, radios, and Internet. There are regional differences in the perception of A/H1N1.',\n",

The current study shows that emotional distress was relatively mild in China as few residents worried about being infected (25.1%). This phenomenon may also be related to the previous experience of the SARS epidemic, as well as the open epidemic information. A survey in Korean university showed that women perceived higher illness severity and personal susceptibility to A/ H1N1 infection, which had been reconfirmed in our study  . Logistic regression analysis results suggested that women with higher educational level had higher perception of risk. As time went by, the knowledge about the main transmission route increased, but the risk perception of being infected in residents decreased, suggesting the positive effect of government policy regarding A/H1N1 infection prevention, as well as the promotion of the media.The previous study presented various results of influencing factors on the the compliance with the preventive practices.',\n",

We found female with higher education took more precautionary behaviors, but office staffs and farmers took less comparing with students. While such differences could result from study population demographics, profound differences may also exist in the knowledge of A/H1N1 and the perceptions of recommended behaviors in those countries. Adjusting for the background factors, the multivariate logistic regression showed the possible relationship between knowledge and risk perception, knowledge and practices (odd ratios were 1.57 and 2.09, respectively), which indicated that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction.',\n",
       "  'Similar findings were observed in other studies performed during A/ H1N1 pandemic in Singapore  and during SARS pandemic in Hong Kong  . Therefore, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. Injecting vaccination is an effective measure to prevent infectious disease  . In China, the seasonal influenza vaccination is not included in the national immunization program and must be purchased by recipients. Those who are above 60 years old, the pupil and children in kindergarten, and people with chronic diseases are recommended to get inoculation. Data provided by China CDC in 2009 showed that the immunization rate of the seasonal flu in Chinese population was below 2%  , which was much lower than 7.5% in our study (P < 0.0001).',\n",

People who couldn't access the A/H1N1 vaccine may take up seasonal flu vaccine as preventive behaviors. The A/ H1N1 vaccine was not available in China until the middle of September 2009. All populations at high risk above three years old were invited for vaccination free of charge  . A survey among 868 European travelers showed 14.2% participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1  , higher than 10.8% in our study (P < 0.01). Our study also showed students and health care workers were more likely to take up, which may be due to the prior vaccination strategy.\",\n",
       "  \"Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, which allowed us to adjust for background factors, further showed the perceived risk of infection and the knowledge about the main modes of transmission related to A/H1N1 vaccination were insignificantly, similar results seen in Lau's study  . Therefore, the vaccination rate of A/H1N1 is not expected to increase even if the virus becomes more prevalent or the knowledge of its transmission mode improved. Additionally, the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccine was associated with perceptions of vaccine's safety and influence on daily life by A/H1N1 as well as the knowledge about the free vaccination policy and the state's initial vaccination strategy. This suggests that improving the safety of vaccine, the acceptability of side effect and the knowledge about the state's strategy related to A/H1N1 vaccination in residents may be helpful to promote A/H1N1 vaccination in the general population. The cross-sectional telephone survey adopted in the study has some limitations.\",\n",
       "  \"We were unable to interview the people who did not have phones and the depth of the questionnaire was largely limited because questions and pre-existing answers could not be too long and complex. In addition, the telephone response rate was 46.8%, which means more than half of the interviewees rejected or didn't finish the survey. It was impossible to compare the difference between respondents and nonrespondents due to the lack of their basic information.This A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic as most of them confused the transmission route of A/H1N1. There are many factors influencing the KAP related to A/H1N1. Female with higher educational level had higher perceived risk of infection and took more precautionary behaviors. Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account.\",\n",

       " ['In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.',\n",
       "  'We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.Text: Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. A human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Most recently, an SARS-related CoV was implicated as the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak in Wuhan, central China. This outbreak is estimated to have started on 12th December 2019 and 17,332 laboratory confirmed cases with 361 deaths as of 3rd February 2020 in China  . The virus has spread to 23 other countries by travellers from Wuhan  . Typical symptoms are fever, malaise, shortness of breath and in severe cases, pneumonia    . The disease was first called unidentified viral pneumonia.We quickly identified the etiological agent, termed 2019-nCoV (virus name designated by the World Health Organization).',\n",
       "  'The newly identified virus is an SARS-related virus (SARSr-CoV) but shares only 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV  . We developed molecular detection tools based on viral spike genes. Our previous studies indicate that qPCR method can be used for the detection of 2019-nCoV in oral swabs or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)  .Additionally, we developed IgM and IgG detection methods using a cross-reactive nucleocapsid protein (NP) from another SARSr-CoV Rp3  , which is 92% identical to 2019-nCoV NP. Using these serological tools, we demonstrate viral antibody titres increase in patients infected with 2019-nCoV  .Like SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV induced pneumonia through respiratory tract by clinical observation. Therefore, the presence of viral antigen in oral swabs was used as detection standard for 2019-nCoV.',\n",
       "  'Similarly, two times of oral swabs negative in a 24-h interval was considered as viral clearance by patients officially.Here we launched an investigation of 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.Human samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples were collected by Wuhan pulmonary hospital with the consent from all patients and approved by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Two investigations were performed. In the first investigation, we collected samples from 39 patients, 7 of which were in severe conditions. In the second investigation, we collected samples from 139 patients, yet their clinical records were not available. We only showed patients who were viral nucleotide detection positive. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where indicated. For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM+2% FBS medium was added in each tube.',\n",

For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng/well) overnight with recombinant NP. Human sera were used at 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37°C. An anti-Human IgG-HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000.',\n",

The OD value (450-630) was calculated.In the first investigation, we aimed to test whether viral positive can be found in anal swab and blood as well as oral swabs. We conducted a molecular investigation to patients in Wuhan pulmonary hospital, who were detected as oral swabs positive for 2019-nCoV upon admission. We collected blood, oral swabs and anal swabs for 2019-nCoV qPCR test using previously established method  .We found 15 patients who still carry virus following days of medical treatments. Of these patients, 8 were oral swabs positive (53.3%), 4 were anal swabs positive (26.7%), 6 blood positives (40%) and 3 serum positives (20%).',\n",
       "  'Two patients were positive by both oral swab and anal swab, yet none of the blood positive was also swabs positive. Not surprisingly, all serum positives were also whole serum positive (Table 1 ). In summary, viral nucleotide can be found in anal swab or blood even if it cannot be detected in oral swabs. It should be noted that although swabs may be negative, the patient might still be viremic.We then did another investigation to find out the dynamic changes of viral presence in two consecutive studies in both oral and anal swabs in another group of patients. The target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission. We tested for both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels by previously established method  . We showed that both IgM and IgG titres were relatively low or undetectable in day 0 (the day of first sampling).',\n",
       "  'On day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients, which was normally considered as a transition from earlier to later period of infection ( Figure 1 and supplementary table 1 ). IgM positive rate increased from 50% (8/16) to 81% (13/16), whereas IgG positive rate increased from 81% (13/16) to 100% (16/16). This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test (below). For molecular detection, we found 8 oral swabs positive (50%) and 4 anal swabs (25%) in these 16 people on day 0. On day 5, we were only able to find 4 oral swabs positive (25%). In contrast, we found 6 anal swabs positive (37.5%). When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5.',\n",
       "  'We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%). Another observation is the reoccurrence of virus in 6 patients who were detected negative on day 0. Of note, 4 of these 6 viral positives were from anal swabs ( Table 2) . These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen.Within 1 month of the 2019-nCoV disease outbreak, we rapidly developed molecular and serological detection tools. This is the first molecular and serological study on this virus after the initial identification of 2019-NCoV from 7 patients diagnosed with unidentified viral pneumonia  . We detected the virus in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood, thus infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal-oral or body fluid routes.',\n",
       "  'In addition, we successfully applied serology test a large population and showed which could greatly improved detection positive rate.We show that the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection was observed at later stages of infection    . However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people. In contrast, we found viral antibodies in near all patients, indicating serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology.',\n",
       "  'A possible shift from oral positive during early infection to anal swab positive during late infection can be observed. This observation implied that we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection.In summary, we provide a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through multiple routes. Both molecular and serological tests are needed to definitively confirm a virus carrier.'],\n",

The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission. The surveillance objectives were to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management.

Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined (171 contacts in France and 200 in Germany for the clusters in Haute-Savoie and Bavaria, respectively), further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated when they develop symptoms [15, 20] .

However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.Three cases were aged 65 years or over.

Given the small sample size, and limited completeness for some variables, all the results presented should be interpreted with caution.With increasing numbers of cases in Europe, data from surveillance and investigations in the region can build on the evidence from countries in Asia experiencing more widespread transmission particularly on disease spectrum and the proportion of infections with severe outcome  .',\n",

Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread.Additional research is needed to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China.',\n",

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.',\n",

The exact value of the reporting rate was difficult to determine due to lack of serological surveillance data. The reporting rate can be determined if serological surveillance data are available for a population; we would know who was infected (seropositive) and who was not (seronegative), with high confidence. The reporting rate is the ratio of reported cases over the number of seropositive individuals.

The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.',\n",

There are four genera of CoVs, namely, Alphacoronavirus (αCoV), Betacoronavirus (βCoV), Deltacoronavirus (δCoV), and Gammacoronavirus (γCoV)  . Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most αCoVs and βCoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most δCoVs and γCoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.',\n",

In both of these epidemics, these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] before crossing species barriers to infect humans.Prior to December 2019, 6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43 [ HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly  .',\n",

The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ).

Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor.',\n",

However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity.A novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b ( Figure 4 ).

Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-β at synthesis and signalling  . Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV  . IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis.

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated.

However, patients may have other respiratory symptoms, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgia, and headache. Bilateral infiltrates may be seen on chest X-ray. Severe cases may present with sepsis and even shock. Conversely, some patients may present as only mildly ill or asymptomatic altogether. 21 To date, patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly are more likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization, and ultimately die. 22 Early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similar coronaviruses.

However, as with the development of any 3I Tool, it is essential to understand specific characteristics of the disease. In the case of a novel virus such as 2019-CoV, this is challenging since information is rapidly evolving and the science is not yet fully understood. It is possible that the virus will undergo mutations over time that could substantially change itsThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus Koenig et al. features. Nevertheless, an appreciation of the key concepts that drive evidence-based management is beneficial (Table 1) . Management guidance will likely change over time.With the initial discovery of a new potential public health threat, it will likely be unclear how patients become sick. For example, rather than a contagion, there could be a contaminant or a toxin responsible for signs and symptoms.',\n",
       "  'In this case, the possibility of an environmental toxin in the Wuhan Market was a consideration early on when limited to no human-tohuman transmission was reported. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings. 25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins. 26 Another important consideration for application of the 3I Tool is whether the disease is contagious prior to symptom onset (like measles) or only after symptoms develop (like Ebola). A January 30, 2020 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine describes a purported confirmed instance of transmission from an asymptomatic individual. Researchers state that, before symptom onset, the primary case infected two individuals, one of which infected two additional colleagues.',\n",
       "  '27 Subsequent investigation suggested that the source patient did have mild symptoms and had taken an antipyretic, calling this reported asymptomatic transmission into question.While quarantine may not be feasible and can have unintended consequences, 28, 29, 30 it is a public health tool that can be considered in cases when disease is transmissible before symptom onset. 30 Conversely, if a disease is known not to be transmissible prior to symptom onset, asymptomatic exposed patients must be monitored, but do not require quarantine or isolation unless they develop symptoms.Initially, it may be unclear whether an infectious agent occurred naturally or was deliberately or accidentally released. In this case, a BSL-4 laboratory studying coronaviruses was located approximately 32 kilometers away from the market where initial exposures were felt to occur. 31 Recall that in 2001, the anthrax letter attacks were initially thought to be naturally occurring.',\n",
       "  \"Once determined to be bioterrorism, management of the event was similar to that for a chemical exposure with a sudden impact, defined scene, and need for a rapid response and decontamination on site. This differed from the WHO's modeling predicting an aerosolized release that would result in an incubation period with 100,000 or more persons exposed rather than the 22 people who contracted anthrax in 2001. 32 By understanding the key features of a novel disease, healthcare workers can take evidence-based measures to protect themselves, optimize individual patient management, and prevent further disease spread.It is currently unclear how 2019-nCoV is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. There are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in Wuhan City. 21 Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission.\",\n",
       "  'CDC defines \"close contact\" 33 as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. 34 The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus and effectively preventing transmission.The current majority of 2019-nCoV cases have been within China and its bordering countries. 2 Persons with recent travel (within 14 days) to Wuhan City or another region with widespread disease, or exposure to a patient under investigation, are considered to have an epidemiologic risk factor and should be assessed for signs and symptoms of a viral illness such as fever and respiratory symptoms.',\n",

At this time, the CDC has the only laboratory that can definitively test for 2019-nCoV, though laboratory testing capacity is being rapidly expanded. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts will be used to confirm potential cases. In addition, serum antibody titers can be analyzed for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity.

Physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. In order to relate these symptoms to 2019-nCoV, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-nCoV can be completed. Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. Many commercially available respiratory panels include \"coronavirus\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.Supportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current CDC treatment guidelines for 2019-nCoV.',\n",

In the future, antiviral medications may be available. If a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia develops, targeted antibiotics are indicated.Prevention of 2019-nCoV transmission, like any other infectious agent, involves minimizing risk of exposure. Vaccines are under accelerated development and may be useful in the future for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare personnel are at increased risk and should practice standard, droplet, and airborne precautions when encountering an infected person, a PUI, or any symptomatic close contacts.

If patients do not meet medical criteria for hospitalization, they may be discharged home with isolation precautions and continued observation. EPs must notify local public health authorities so appropriate monitoring and community protective measures can be instituted.The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool was initially developed for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 This novel tool for suspected 2019-nCoV patients ( Figure 1 ) provides frontline clinicians with a simple algorithm to manage an emerging disease.',\n",

The 2019-nCoV Tool provides an accurate, summarized algorithm to immediately, and effectively manage suspected patients until additional resources can be consulted.Patients who do not have an exposure risk or any symptoms may be triaged normally. However, before making patient contact, providers must first apply the Vital Sign Zero concept. 36 Vital Sign Zero is a preliminary, non-contact assessment (i.e., performed prior to touching a patient to take traditional vital signs) to first determine whether specific PPE is indicated before the examination commences.',\n",
       "  'By taking the additional time to complete this assessment, risk of exposure and further transmission can be minimized. while in the treatment facility should be started and maintained to assist with the possibility of contact tracing. Following isolation, physicians should immediately inform the appropriate authorities. Patients who do not meet medical criteria for admission can be isolated at home during the evaluation phase. 37 Health department officials can help prevent transmission in isolated patients by providing in-home monitoring and implementing appropriate exposure-control measures.Providers in the prehospital setting who have a high likelihood of encountering 2019-nCoV patients, such as those near international ports of entry, should adhere to established exposure control guidelines. 38 Along with appropriate PPE, providers should also carry thermometers to quantify any fever. In the US, providers should contact the appropriate CDC quarantine station upon isolation of infected or suspected patients, especially those from Wuhan, China or other regions with widespread disease, who report symptoms in the last 14 days.',\n",

Response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisessuch as the recent cholera epidemic in Yemen and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congois a global health challenge of increasing scale  . The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings.Populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization.',\n",
       "  'Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. These situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations  .As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises.',\n",
       "  'Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crisesaffected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. Respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing  .',\n",
       "  \"Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30%  . Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production  .The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance  . However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8] .\",\n",
       "  'And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence  . Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.Evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations  . Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings  .'],\n",
       " [\"nanText: Influenza and influenza viruses are wellknown popular topics to medical professionals and the general public. Influenza viruses had caused a pandemic globally during 1918 and 1919, and that influenza pandemic had taken away more than 20 million people's lives in the world. However, in my opinion, it is unlikely that influenza viruses will again cause a pandemic on a level (both of the morbidity rate and the mortality rate) comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919.Influenza viruses very easily reassort, recombine, and point mutate in nature due to their segmented RNA genome structures, however, unlike highly pathogenic (virulent) viruses like rabies virus, Lassa fever virus, smallpox virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1); most influenza viruses (wild types and mutants) are moderately pathogenic.\",\n",
       "  'The case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in Table 1 .On November 11, 1918 , the fighting of World War I was stopped, and World War I was officially ended on June 28, 1919 with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. It is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I due to battle. The war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. Millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. For example, about 700,000 Germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide.',\n",
       "  'Those people were killed both directly and indirectly by influenza virus infections. Many families were too poor to buy food and coal, and to afford health care expenses when their family members were ill. Influenza virus could infect all members of a family, and this could result in no one left to feed the fires, and to prepare food for the whole family, even if they had firewood, coal, and food left in their homes. Sadly, a large number of people died of influenza virus infections along with starvation, cold, and poor living conditions (8) .In recent years, while hunger and malnutrition are not major and serious problems in some developed countries anymore, they are still very difficult to overcome in many developing countries. In these less-developed countries, there were approximately 925 million people who suffered from hunger; 125 million children were underweight; and 195 million children were stunted each year (9) .',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. Furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil. We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time.',\n",
       "  'Actually, in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) .Because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future.Additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . Some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) .The World Health Organization (WHO) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on June 11, 2009 (15) .',\n",
       "  'However, the truth was that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . Some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . I believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . Not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. The severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity.',\n",
       "  \"Some researchers' opinions on H7N9 avian influenza virus were incorrect and/or inadequate. They mainly focused on influenza viruses and worried about viral mutations, viral pathogenicity, viral adaptation, and transmission. They overestimated the negative part of socio-economic factors of the present east China: overcrowded population in the epidemic region; very busy national and international transportation and travel; a large number of live poultry markets . . . but they underestimated the currently changed, developed, and improved positive part of socio-economic factors in China. The following factors might be used to explain why that H7N9 influenza A virus epidemic was limited and controlled in China, and only a few immunocompromised patients were killed by H7N9 influenza A virus. First, China has a relatively organized and effective public health system, there are four levels of (national, provincial, prefectural-level city, and county) centers for disease control and prevention all over China (24) .\",\n",
       "  'Second, physicians and nurses in China were prepared and knowledgeable of influenza virus infections. Third, samples from patients with suspected influenza virus infections were collected and sent to the local and national centers for disease control and prevention promptly. H7N9 influenza A viruses were isolated and identified very quickly. Thereby, they were able to diagnose, confirm, and report three cases of H7N9 influenza patients in the early stage of the epidemic (24, 25) . Fourth, health care and public health workers were protected properly. Consequently, none of the health professionals was infected by H7N9 influenza A virus in 2013. However, a surgeon died of H7N9 influenza in Shanghai, China in January of 2014 (26) . Fifth, they detected H7N9 influenza A viruses from the samples of chickens, pigeons, and the environment of live poultry markets in Shanghai (27) ; and closed the live poultry markets of the involved epidemic region quickly.',\n",
       "  'Sixth, patients were isolated and treated timely in hospitals, 74% (1251/1689) of those close contacts of H7N9 influenza patients were monitored and observed. Thus, H7N9 influenza A virus could not spread to a bigger population (24) . Last but not least, we are connected to the Internet now, and it seems that our planet is much smaller today than the earlier days when we did not have the Internet, because communication and information exchange have become so fast, easy, and convenient presently. During that avian influenza epidemic, some influenza experts in the world shared/exchanged H7N9 influenza A virus information and provided professional consultations and suggestions efficiently and rapidly. All these public health routine practices and measures resulted in that H7N9 influenza epidemic being controlled and stopped in China (24) . I have to point out that the cases of diagnosed H7N9 avian influenza A virus infection might only be the tip of the iceberg.',\n",
       "  \"Aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of H7N9 influenza A virus infection in Beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza A H7N9 infection. The reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23).Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses.\",\n",
       "  'However, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. I believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. Now, I first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. We should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. It is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future.',\n",

       "[' mother-to-child transmission (mtct) is the main cause of hiv-1 infection in children worldwide. given that the c-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific icam-grabbing non-integrin-related (dc-signr, also known as cd209l or liver/lymph node–specific icam-grabbing non-integrin (l-sign)), can interact with pathogens including hiv-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence mtct of hiv-1. methods and findings: to investigate the potential role of dc-signr in mtct of hiv-1, we carried out a genetic association study of dc-signr in a well-characterized cohort of 197 hiv-infected mothers and their infants recruited in harare, zimbabwe. infants harbouring two copies of dc-signr h1 and/or h3 haplotypes (h1-h1, h1-h3, h3-h3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (iu) (p = 0.013) hiv-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (ip) (p = 0.025) hiv-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors.',\n",
       " 'the implicated h1 and h3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in promoter region (p-198a) and intron 2 (int2-180a) that were associated with increased risk of both iu (p = 0.045 and p = 0.003, respectively) and ip (p = 0.025, for int2-180a) hiv-1 infection. the promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. in homozygous h1 infants bearing both the p-198a and int2-180a mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental dc-signr transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (p = 0.011). conclusion: these results suggest that dc-signr plays a crucial role in mtct of hiv-1 and that impaired placental dc-signr expression increases risk of transmission.text: without specific interventions, the rate of hiv-1 mother-tochild transmission (mtct) is approximately 15-45%  . unaids estimates that last year alone, more than 400,000 children were infected worldwide, mostly through mtct and 90% of them lived in sub-saharan africa.',\n",
       " 'genetic variants in ccr5 have been shown to influence vertical transmission of hiv-1. ccr5 promoter variants resulting in higher expression of the receptor were associated with increased risk of mtct of hiv-1 among sub-saharan africans [25, 26] . the 32-pb deletion polymorphism in ccr5 has be shown to protect from vertical transmission of hiv-1  , but this variant is virtually absent among african populations  . high copy numbers of ccl3l1, a potent hiv-1 suppressive ligand for ccr5, are associated with higher chemokine production and lower risk of mtct of hiv-1 among south african infants [29, 30] . mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is an innate immune receptor synthesised in the liver and secreted in the bloodstream in response to inflammation signal.',\n",
       " 'in the most heavilyaffected countries, such as zimbabwe, hiv-1 is responsible for one third of all deaths among children under the age of five. mtct of hiv-1 can occur during pregnancy (in utero, iu), delivery (intrapartum, ip) or breastfeeding (postpartum, pp). high maternal viral load, low cd4 cells count, vaginal delivery, low gestational age have all been identified as independent factors associated with mtct of hiv-1  . although antiretrovirals can reduce mtct to 2%, limited access to timely diagnostics and drugs in many developing world countries limits the potential impact of this strategy. a better understanding of the mechanisms acting at the maternal-fetal interface is crucial for the design of alternative interventions to antiretroviral therapy for transmission prevention.dendritic cell-specific icam-grabbing non-integrin-related (dc-signr, also known as cd209l or liver/lymph node-specific icam-grabbing non-integrin (l-sign)) can interact with a plethora of pathogens including hiv-1 and is expressed in placental capillary endothelial cells  .',\n",

       " 'recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (ifitm) family proteins, ifitm3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza a (h1n1) virus infection. in this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed s-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. ifitm3 possesses three cysteine residues for the s-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (tm1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (cp) loop. because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian ifitm family proteins, the s-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. ifitm5 is another ifitm family protein and interacts with the fk506-binding protein 11 (fkbp11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. in this study, we investigated the role played by s-palmitoylation of ifitm5 in its interaction with fkbp11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression.',\n",
       " 'our investigations using an established reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-odya), and an inhibitor for the s-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2bp), revealed that ifitm5 was s-palmitoylated in addition to ifitm3. specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the tm1 domain and in the cp loop were s-palmitoylated in ifitm5. then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of ifitm5 with fkbp11 was inhibited in the presence of 2bp. the mutant lacking the s-palmitoylation site in the tm1 domain lost the interaction with fkbp11. these results indicate that the s-palmitoylation on ifitm5 promotes the interaction with fkbp11. finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2bp, because ifitm5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. the experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule.',\n",

(i) expression of ifitm5: unlike the other ifitm family proteins, the expression of ifitm5 is not induced by interferons because the region upstream of the ifitm5 gene lacks the interferon regulatory elements  .',\n",

(iii) role of ifitm5 in bone formation: the expression of ifitm5 is associated with mineralization during the bone formation process in osteoblast cells     . previous studies have confirmed the expression of ifitm5 in bone tissues in mice, rats, humans and tammar wallabies  . the ifitm5-gene knockout mice have smaller bones  . moreover, the knockdown of the ifitm5 gene by small hairpin rna induces a decrease in bone nodule formation, whereas overexpression of the gene in umr106 cells has been shown to increase calcium uptake and bone nodule formation  .',\n",

       " 'following the successful cloning of receptor for sars coronavirus a few years ago, dr. wenhui li and colleagues raised attention again by publishing a possible receptor for hepatitis b virus in elife. we will briefly review the significance of this finding and the future prospects of hepatitis b research.text: among the five hepatotropic hepatitis viruses, only hepatitis b virus (hbv) and its satellite hepatitis d virus (hdv) still wait for the development of an in vitro infection system in cell culture. one hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) cell line, heparg, can be infected at a modest efficiency after weeks of culture and induced differentiation  . even primary human hepatocytes rapidly lose the capacity for hbv infection after brief cell culture. the hbv infection demands both intracellular and cell-surface factors. the intracellular requirements appear less stringent, as after transfection of hbv dna into many hcc cell lines or mouse liver, which cannot be infected naturally, the viral genome is expressed and replicates actively.',\n",
       " 'thus, the failure of hbv infection is considered largely to be due to strict restriction on the interaction between hbv virions and the cell membrane.the molecules on the cell membrane needed for hbv infection can be divided into two classes: low affinity and high affinity molecules. among others, the heparan sulfates in the membrane proteins mediate the broad, but less specific, virus-cell interaction. however, the high affinity membrane partners for hbv remain elusive (the carboxypeptidase d found for duck hepatitis b virus may be the only serious contender  ).hbv envelope protein, namely the surface antigens, plays an essential role in the infection process. both genetic and functional examination identified one domain in the nterminus of hbv pres1 (amino acids 1-47) necessary for infection. this domain has been shown to function as a direct mediator for hbv by binding presumably cellular corresponding receptor(s)  .',\n",

       " 'moreover, the authors could convert the cell lines previously non-permissible to hbv infection to permissible by over-expression of ntcp, again supporting its possible role in the hbv infection process. this can be a critical and long-awaited discovery toward understanding hbv receptors and establishing an experimental hbv infection system.looking forward, we need to understand how ntcp interacts with both hbv envelope proteins and with other cellular proteins, especially through the motif embedded in the cell membrane. ntcp itself is not sufficient to allow hbv infection, as the majority of heparg cells were found to express npct but not to be infected  . ntcp might initiate or mediate molecular interactions that can overcome the cell-surface restrictions for viral entry. such cooperative cellular or viral factors have to be discovered and demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of viral infection, at a level comparable to a natural one (hundreds or thousands fold viral amplification).',\n",

       " 'for efficient gene silencing in the lungs, sirnas must be delivered to their site of action, be stable, enter the target cells, and be present in the cytoplasm at sufficient concentration. once the sirnas reach the target cells, they must be trafficked into the cytoplasm and taken up by argonaute (ago)2/rna-induced silencing complex (risc), which degrades mrnas and, subsequently, suppresses the sequence-specific gene expression. for efficient endocytosis to occur, particles should be under 150 nm in size. particles within this size range could also avoid macrophage uptake and delayed lung clearance  . the physicochemical properties of sirnas also play a significant role in crossing the biological membrane. despite their small size, the negative charge and chemical degradability of sirna molecules prevent them from readily crossing biological membranes. therefore, efficient sirna delivery approaches need to overcome this limitation by facilitating cellular uptake.',\n",

       " 'this is the subject of this review. in discussing the possible effects on pre-existing immunity, the natural immunity to the vector needs to be considered. therefore, considering a vector such as salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust b and t memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response). this will theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared. surprisingly, as will be seen in some of the examples given below, this can have results that differ depending on the magnitude of the response to the vectored antigen. similarly, for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen.',\n",
       " 'in view of this finding, it was perhaps not surprising that at day 210 the lps titres were not significantly different between groups receiving one or two vaccinations. more interestingly, mice that had been primed with salmonella alone, and then boosted with salmonella expressing tetc, induced much lower anti-tetc responses than mice that had not been primed. this argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses. whether the same is true for cellular responses was not evaluated.other studies have evaluated cellular responses. a study by sevil domènech and colleagues reported that pre-existing anti-vector immunity seriously compromises cd8 + responses in mice when exposed to a similar strain used as vector (sevil domènech et al., 2007) . in contrast, another study by the same authors reported that animals exposed to related vectors induce much higher cd8 + responses when compared with animals which do not have any pre-existing salmonella immunity (sevil domènech et al., 2008) .',\n",
       " 'leong et al. (2009) also demonstrated that the negative impact of vector-specific immune responses can also be countered by repeated immunization with the same vaccine and dose; this in effect leads to higher priming of naive t cells against the delivered antigen. of course, such repeated vaccination may not be practicable in real-world situations.despite the many advantages which viral vectoring can offer, pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the us population, respectively] (hocknell et al., 2002; pichla-gollon et al., 2009) . vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens (pichla-gollon et al., 2009; pine et al., 2011) .',\n",
       " 'in a large-scale clinical trial (step) of an ad serotype 5 (adhu5)-based hiv-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of hiv-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to adhu5 (buchbinder et al., 2008) . for an hsv-1-based vector vaccine, it has been demonstrated that pre-existing anti-hsv-1 immunity reduced, but did not abolish, humoral and cellular immune responses against the vaccine-encoded antigen (hocknell et al., 2002; lauterbach et al., 2005) . however, brockman and knipe found that the induction of durable antibody responses and cellular proliferative responses to hsvencoded antigen were not affected by prior hsv immunity (brockman & knipe, 2002) . similarly, pre-existing immunity to poliovirus has little effect on vaccine efficacy in a poliovirus-vectored vaccine (mandl et al., 2001) .',\n",
       " 'different effects of pre-existing immunity on the efficacy of recombinant viral vaccine vectors are summarized in table 2 .there are several approaches to avoiding pre-existing vector immunity, such as the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (kahl et al., 2010; lasaro & ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (gabitzsch & jones, 2011; roberts et al., 2006) . the inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the ad vector inside dendritic cells (dcs) (steffensen et al., 2012) . in addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (alexander et al., 2012; belyakov et al., 1999; priddy et al., 2008; xiang et al., 2003) .as we search for new vaccine approaches for the array of pathogens for which none is yet available, revisiting proven vaccines and developing these further has gained m. saxena and others momentum.',\n",
       " 'saxena and colleagues also reported that antigenspecific t cell responses were either similar or significantly higher, with no downregulation in t cell responses observed after pre-exposing mice to either homologous or heterologous strains (saxena et al., 2009) .for viral vectors, the impact of cell-mediated immunity was more pronounced, and as depicted in table 2 , almost always resulted in a reduction in the subsequent immune response. presumably this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. this is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes (lasaro & ertl, 2009) . as these authors conclude, it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes.',\n",

       " '35like other related coronaviruses, patients with 2019-ncov frequently present with non-specific symptoms resembling that of influenza. physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. in order to relate these symptoms to 2019-ncov, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-ncov can be completed. although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-ncov and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-ncov. many commercially available respiratory panels include \"coronavirus\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-ncov.supportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current cdc treatment guidelines for 2019-ncov.',\n",
       " 'nantext: over 168 million people across 50 countries are estimated to need humanitarian assistance in 2020  . response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisessuch as the recent cholera epidemic in yemen and the ebola epidemic in the democratic republic of congois a global health challenge of increasing scale  . the thousands of yemeni and congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings.populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to covid-19, the disease caused by sars-cov-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (wash) tools, and stigmatization.',\n",
       " 'disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. these situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations  .as the international community responds to sars-cov-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. these standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. for example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises.',\n",
       " 'frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on crisesaffected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as sars-cov-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing  .',\n",
       " \"hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30%  . furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production  .the sphere handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance  . however, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian wash standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8] .\",\n",
       " 'and yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence  . gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current sars-cov-2 pandemic. without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations  . diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings  .',\n",
       " 'the case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in table 1 .on november 11, 1918 , the fighting of world war i was stopped, and world war i was officially ended on june 28, 1919 with the signing of the versailles treaty. it is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in world war i due to battle. the war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. for example, about 700,000 germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide.',\n",
       " 'nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like tylenol or advil. we do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time.',\n",
       " 'actually, in the united states of america, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) .because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future.additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie b virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) .the world health organization (who) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on june 11, 2009 (15) .',\n",
       " 'however, the truth was that most cases of h1n1 influenza a virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in new zealand (16) ; and in new york city, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . i believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. the severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity.',\n",
       " \"aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of h7n9 influenza a virus infection in beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza a h7n9 infection. the reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. in most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from taiwan, and one case from hong kong) (22, 23).nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other rna viruses.\",\n",
       " 'however, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. i believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the who global influenza surveillance and response system, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. now, i first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. we should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. it is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future.']"
